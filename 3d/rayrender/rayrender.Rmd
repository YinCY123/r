# Overview  
**rayrender** is an open source R package for raytracing scenes in created in R. Based off of Peter Shirley's three books "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", "Ray Tracing: The Next Week", and "Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life", this package provides a tidy R API to raytracer built in C++ to render scenes built out of an array of primitives. **rayrender** builds scenes using a pipeable iterative interface, and supports diffuse, metallic, dielectri (glass), light emitting materials, as well as procedural and user-specified image textures and HDR environment lighting. **rayrender** includes multicore support (with progress bars) via RcppThread, random number generation via the PCC RNG, and `.obj` file support via TinyObjLoader.  


## Usage  
We'll first start by rendering a simple scene consisting of the ground, a sphere, and the included `R.obj` file. The location of the `R.obj` file can be accessed by calling the function `r_obj()`. First adding the ground using the `render_ground()` function. This renders an extremely large sphere that (at our scene's scale) functions as a flat surface. We also add a simple red sphere to the scene.  

```{r}
library(rayrender)
library(rayshader)
library(magrittr)

scene <- generate_ground() %>% 
    add_object(sphere(material = diffuse(color = "#ff5555")))

render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 800, height = 800, samples = 1000)
```

By default, a scene without any lights includes a blue sky. We can turn this off either by setting `ambient_light=FALSE`, or by adding a light to our scene. We will add an emissive sphere above and bending our carmera.  

```{r}
scene <- generate_ground() %>% 
    add_object(sphere(material = diffuse(color = "#ff5555", sigma = 100))) %>% 
    add_object(sphere(x = 5, y = 5, z = 5, radius = 3, 
                      material = light(intensity = 10)))


render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 800, height = 800, samples = 1000)
```

Now we'll add the (included) R.obj file into the scene, using the `obj_model()` function. We will scale it down slightly using the `scale_obj` argument, and then embed it on the surface of the ball. We'll also turn down the light intensity.  

```{r}
scene <- generate_ground() %>% 
    add_object(sphere(material = diffuse(color = "#ff5555"))) %>% 
    add_object(obj_model(r_obj(), y = -0.4, z = 0.9, scale_obj = 0.6)) %>% 
    add_object(sphere(y = 5, z = 5, x = 5, radius = 3, 
                      material = light(intensity = 5)))

render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 800, 
             height = 800, samples = 1000, 
             fov = 20)
```

render a grid of different viewpoints  
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 400, height = 400, lookfrom = c(7, 1, 7), samples = 1000)
render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 400, height = 400, lookfrom = c(0, 7, 7), samples = 1000)
render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 400, height = 400, lookfrom = c(-7, 0, 7), samples = 1000)
render_scene(scene = scene, parallel = T, width = 400, height = 400, lookfrom = c(-7, 7, 7), samples = 1000)
```


We start by generating an empty Cornell box and rendering it with `render_scene()`. Setting `parallel = TRUE` will utilize all available cores on your machine. The `lookat`, `lookfrom`, `aperture`, and `fov` arguments control the camera, an the `samples` argument controls how many samples to take at each pixel. Higher sample counts result in a less noisy image.  

```{r}
scene <- generate_cornell()

render_scene(scene = scene, 
             lookfrom = c(278, 278, -800), 
             lookat = c(278, 278, 0), 
             aperture = 0, 
             fov = 40, 
             samples = 1000, 
             ambient_light = F, 
             parallel = F, 
             width = 800, 
             height = 800, 
             clamp_value = 5)
```


Here we add a metal ellipsoid, a checkered purple cube, a colored glass sphere, a pig, and plaster the walls with the iris dataset using textures applied to rectangles. We first write the textures out to a temporary filenames, and then read the image back in using the `png::readPNG()` function. We then apss this to the `image` argument in the diffuse material, which applies it as a texture.  

```{r}
tempfileplot <- tempfile()
png(filename = tempfileplot, height = 1600, width = 1600)
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, col = iris$Species, pch = 18, cex = 12)
dev.off()
```

```{r}
image_array <- png::readPNG(tempfileplot)

generate_cornell() %>% 
    add_object(ellipsoid(x = 555/2, y = 100, z = 555/2, 
                         a = 50, b = 100, c = 50, 
                         material = metal(color = "lightblue"))) %>% 
    add_object(scene = cube(x = 100, y = 130/2, z = 200, 
                            xwidth = 130, ywidth = 130, zwidth = 130, 
                            material = diffuse(checkercolor = "purple", checkerperiod = 30), 
                            angle = c(0, 10, 0))) %>% 
    add_object(pig(x = 100, y = 190, z = 200, 
                   scale = 40, angle = c(0, 30, 0))) %>% 
    add_object(sphere(x = 420, y = 555/8, z = 555/8, 
                      radius = 555/8, material = dielectric(color = "orange"))) %>% 
    add_object(yz_rect(x = 0.01, y = 300, z = 555/2, zwidth = 400, ywidth = 400,
                       material = diffuse(image_texture = image_array))) %>% 
    add_object(xz_rect(x = 555/2, y = 300, z = 555-0.01, zwidth = 400, xwidth = 400, 
                       material = diffuse(image_texture = image_array), angle = c(0, 90, 0))) %>% 
    add_object(yz_rect(x = 555-0.01, y = 300, z = 555/2, 
                       zwidth = 400, ywidth = 400, 
                       material = diffuse(image_texture = image_array), 
                       angle = c(0, 180, 0))) %>% 
    render_scene(lookfrom = c(278, 278, -800), lookat = c(278, 278, 0), 
                 aperture = 0, fov = 40, 
                 samples = 1000, ambient_light = F, parallel = F, 
                 width = 800, height = 800, clamp_value = 5)
```


Finally, `rayrender` supports environment lighting with the `environment_light` argument. Pass a high dynamic range image (`.hdr`) or a low-dynamic range image (`.jpg`, `.png`) and the image will be used to light the scene (along with any other lights). Here's an example using an HDR image of Venice at sunset (obtained for free from hdrihaven.com), also using the Oren-Nayar diffuse model with `sigma=90` for a more realistic diffuse surface. We also add an extruded polygon star, using the `extruded_polygon` object.  

```{r}
env_lights <- "venice_sunset_2k.hdr"

# create star polygon
angles <- seq(0, 360, by = 36)
xx <- rev(c(rep(c(0.5, 1), times = 5), 1) * sinpi(angles/180))
yy <- rev(c(rep(c(0.5, 1), times = 5), 1) * cospi(angles/180))
star_polygon <- data.frame(x = xx, y = yy)
hollow_star <- rbind(star_polygon, 0.8 * star_polygon)

generate_ground(material = diffuse(color = "grey20", checkercolor = "grey50", sigma = 90)) %>% 
    add_object(sphere(material = metal())) %>% 
    add_object(obj_model(r_obj(), x = -1.8, y = -1, angle = c(0, 135, 0), material = diffuse(sigma = 90))) %>% 
    add_object(pig(x = 1.8, y = -1.2, scale = 0.5, angle = c(0, 90, 0), diffuse_sigma = 90)) %>% 
    add_object(extruded_polygon(polygon = hollow_star, top = -0.5, bottom = -1, z = -2, 
                                holes = nrow(star_polygon), 
                                material = diffuse(color = "red", sigma = 90))) %>% 
    render_scene(parallel = T, environment_light = env_lights, 
                 width = 800, height = 800, 
                 fov = 70, clamp_value = 10, 
                 samples = 1000, aperture = 0.5, 
                 lookfrom = c(-0.9, 1.2, -4.5), 
                 lookat = c(0, -1, 0))
```
