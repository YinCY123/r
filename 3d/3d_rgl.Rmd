# 3d plot with rgl package  

```{r}
library(rgl)
```

Three dimensional objects are very popular but negatively affect the accuracy and speed at which one can interprete a graphic in most cases.  

Basically, 3d scatterplot and surface plots are the only tolerated exceptions.  

```{r}
data <- iris
mycolors <- c('royalblue1', 'darkcyan', 'oldlace')
data$color <- mycolors[as.numeric(data$Species)]
```

```{r}
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot3d(x = data$Sepal.Length,
       y = data$Sepal.Width,
       z = data$Petal.Length,
       col = data$color,
       type = "s",
       radius = 0.1,
       xlab = "Sepal length",
       ylab = "Sepal Width",
       zlab = "PEtal length")
writeWebGL(filename = "3dscatter.html", width = 600, height = 600)
```
