abstract = {The many functional partnerships and interactions that occur between proteins are at the core of cellular processing and their systematic characterization helps to provide context in molecular systems biology. However, known and predicted interactions are scattered over multiple resources, and the available data exhibit notable differences in terms of quality and completeness. The STRING database (http://string-db.org) aims to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) associations. The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and self-consistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein-protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

@article{Kahles2016,
abstract = {Motivation: Understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative splicing (AS) is a key task towards explaining the regulatory processes that help to shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA, the diversity of AS transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events has ever grown since, novel isoforms are commonly observed when working with less annotated organisms, in the context of diseases, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete isoforms is technically challenging or expensive, focussing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful for differential analyses. Results: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences. Availability: Source code and documentation are available for download at github.com/ratschlab/spladder. Example data, introductory information and a small tutorial are accessible at bioweb.me/spladder.},

@article{Bhuva2019,
abstract = {Elucidation of regulatory networks, including identification of regulatory mechanisms specific to a given biological context, is a key aim in systems biology. This has motivated the move from co-expression to differential co-expression analysis and numerous methods have been developed subsequently to address this task; however, evaluation of methods and interpretation of the resulting networks has been hindered by the lack of known context-specific regulatory interactions. In this study, we develop a simulator based on dynamical systems modelling capable of simulating differential co-expression patterns. With the simulator and an evaluation framework, we benchmark and characterise the performance of inference methods. Defining three different levels of “true” networks for each simulation, we show that accurate inference of causation is difficult for all methods, compared to inference of associations. We show that a z-score-based method has the best general performance. Further, analysis of simulation parameters reveals five network and simulation properties that explained the performance of methods. The evaluation framework and inference methods used in this study are available in the dcanr R/Bioconductor package. Our analysis of networks inferred from simulated data show that hub nodes are more likely to be differentially regulated targets than transcription factors. Based on this observation, we propose an interpretation of the inferred differential network that can reconstruct a putative causal network.},

@article{Liao2013,
abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},
