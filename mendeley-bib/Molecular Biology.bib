abstract = {Directed evolution has proved to be an effective strategy for improving or altering the activity of biomolecules for industrial, research and therapeutic applications. The evolution of proteins in the laboratory requires methods for generating genetic diversity and for identifying protein variants with desired properties. This Review describes some of the tools used to diversify genes, as well as informative examples of screening and selection methods that identify or isolate evolved proteins. We highlight recent cases in which directed evolution generated enzymatic activities and substrate specificities not known to exist in nature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic nucleic acid binding protein database (ENPD, http://qinlab.sls.cuhk.edu.hk/ENPD/) is a library of nucleic acid binding proteins (NBPs) and their functional information. NBPs such as DNA binding proteins (DBPs), RNA binding proteins (RBPs), and DNA and RNA binding proteins (DRBPs) are involved in every stage of gene regulation through their interactions with DNA and RNA. Due to the importance of NBPs, the database was constructed based on manual curation and a newly developed pipeline utilizing both sequenced transcriptomes and genomes. In total the database has recorded 2.8 million of NBPs and their binding motifs from 662 NBP families and 2423 species, constituting the largest NBP database. ENPD covers evolutionarily important lineages which have never been included in the previous NBP databases, while lineage-specific NBP family expansions were also found. ENPD also focuses on the involvements of DBPs, RBPs and DRBPs in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) mediated gene regulation. The predicted and experimentally validated targets of NBPs have both been recorded and manually curated in ENPD, linking the interactions between ncRNAs, DNA regulatory elements and NBPs in gene regulation. This database provides key resources for the scientific community, laying a solid foundation for future gene regulatory studies from both functional and evolutionary perspectives.},

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) mediate a broad range of functions essential for cellular differentiation, function, and survival. However, it is still a daunting task to comprehensively identify and profile sequence-specific PDIs in complex genomes. Here, we have used a combined bioinformatics and protein microarray-based strategy to systematically characterize the human protein-DNA interactome. We identified 17,718 PDIs between 460 DNA motifs predicted to regulate transcription and 4,191 human proteins of various functional classes. Among them, we recovered many known PDIs for transcription factors (TFs). We identified a large number of unanticipated PDIs for known TFs, as well as for previously uncharacterized TFs. We also found that over three hundred unconventional DNA-binding proteins (uDBPs)-which include RNA-binding proteins, mitochondrial proteins, and protein kinases-showed sequence-specific PDIs. One such uDBP, ERK2, acts as a transcriptional repressor for interferon gamma-induced genes, suggesting important biological roles for such proteins. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid, is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is matching with the results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon regulatory factor 1, an INFgamma target gene, efficiently upon IFNgamma addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The differential regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising gene regulatory approach in functional genomics that has significant impact on crop improvement which permits down-regulation in gene expression with greater precise manner without affecting the expression of other genes. RNAi mechanism is expedited by small molecules of interfering RNA to suppress a gene of interest effectively. RNAi has also been exploited in plants for resistance against pathogens, insect/pest, nematodes, and virus that cause significant economic losses. Keeping beside the significance in the genome integrity maintenance as well as growth and development, RNAi induced gene syntheses are vital in plant stress management. Modifying the genes by the interference of small RNAs is one of the ways through which plants react to the environmental stresses. Hence, investigating the role of small RNAs in regulating gene expression assists the researchers to explore the potentiality of small RNAs in abiotic and biotic stress management. This novel approach opens new avenues for crop improvement by developing disease resistant, abiotic or biotic stress tolerant, and high yielding elite varieties.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global gene expression profiles of bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The bovine microarray with 86,191 distinct 60mer oligonucleotides, each with 4 replicates, was designed and produced with Maskless Array Synthesizer technology. These oligonucleotides represent approximately 45,383 unique cattle sequences. RESULTS: 450 genes significantly regulated by butyrate with a median False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0 {\%} were identified. The majority of these genes were repressed by butyrate and associated with cell cycle control. The expression levels of 30 selected genes identified by the microarray were confirmed using real-time PCR. The results from real-time PCR positively correlated (R = 0.867) with the results from the microarray. CONCLUSION: This study presented the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. The profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes. These findings enable better recognition of the full range of beneficial roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and possibly in fighting gastrointestinal pathogens.},

abstract = {DNA–calcium phosphate co-precipitates arise spontaneously in supersaturated solutions. Highly effective precipitates for transfection purposes, however, can be generated only in a very narrow range of physico-chemical conditions that control the initiation and growth of precipitate complexes. The concentrations of calcium and phosphate are the main factors influencing characteristics of the precipitate complex, but other parameters, such as temperature, DNA concentration and reaction time are important as well. An example for this is the finding that almost all of the soluble DNA in the reaction mix can be bound into an insoluble complex with calcium phosphate in {\textless}1 min. Extending the reaction time to 20 min results in aggregation and/or growth of particles and reduces the level of expression. With improved protocols we gained better reproducibility and higher efficiencies both for transient and for stable transfections. Up to 60{\%} of cells stained positive for $\beta$-gal and transient production of secreted proteins was improved 5- to 10-fold over results seen with transfections using standard procedures. Similar improvements in efficiency (number of recombinant cell colonies) were observed with stable transfections, using co-transfected marker plasmids for selection. Transient expression levels 2 days after DNA transfer and titers obtained from stable cell lines, emerging weeks later, showed strong correlation.},

Several different multiple mutations (up to 7 bases) were successfully performed with this partial overlapping primer design in a variety of vectors ranging from 4 to 12 kb in length. In comparison, all attempts failed when using complete-overlapping primer pairs as recommended in the standard QuickChange protocol. Our protocol was further extended to site-saturation mutagenesis by introducing randomized codons. Our data indicated no specific sequence selection during library construction, with the randomized positions resulting in average occurrence of each base in each position.

abstract = {We have examined the discrete species of simian virus 40 (SV40) RNA present very early in infection of monkey cells with wild-type virus, with mutant tsA58 virus, and with the corresponding DNAs to distinguish between two classes of models for control of late transcription: (i) positive control mediated by large-T antigen and (ii) negative control mediated by a repressor protein associated with viral DNA in the virion. Total cytoplasmic or nuclear polyadenylated RNAs from infected cells were denatured with glyoxal, separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels, and transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper. The positions of specific early and late RNA species were determined with region-specific SV40 DNA probes. The technique can detect individual RNAs present at the level of less than one copy per cell. After 9.5 h at 37 degrees C, appreciable amounts of two early RNAs (2.6 kilobases [kb] and 2.9 kb) were present in the cytoplasm of cells infected with wild-type virus or DNA, along with much smaller amounts of two late RNAs, 1.6 kb (16S) and 2.5 kb (19S). The amounts of the late RNAs were reduced, but they were still synthesized in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. In comparable infections with tsA58 virus or DNA at nonpermissive temperature (41 degrees C), substantial amounts of the two early RNAs were again present, but the two late RNAs could not be detected. However, small amounts of the late RNAs were found when infections with tsA58 virus or DNA were prolonged to 30 h at 41 degrees C. These results are not consistent with negative control of late transcription through the action of a repressor and, taken together with other data, suggest that T antigen has an active role in late RNA synthesis. Specific early and late viral RNAs were also detected in the nuclear poly(A)(+) fractions and were similar in size to the RNA species found in the cytoplasmic polyadenylated fractions. The late nuclear RNAs (1.8 and 2.9 kb) were significantly larger than the late cytoplasmic species, possibly because they are precursors. The 2.6- and 2.9-kb early RNAs found in the cytoplasm are probably the messengers for large-T and small-t antigens, respectively.},

abstract = {Enzymes have the potential to catalyse a wide variety of chemical reactions. They are increasingly being sought as environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives to conventional catalysts used in industries ranging from bioremediation to applications in medicine and pharmaceutics. Despite the benefits, they are not without their limitations. Many naturally occurring enzymes are not suitable for use outside of their native cellular environments. However, protein engineering can be used to generate enzymes tailored for specific industrial applications. Directed evolution is particularly useful and can be employed even when lack of structural information impedes the use of rational design. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of current industrial applications of enzyme technology and to show how directed evolution can be used to modify and to enhance enzyme properties. This includes a brief discussion on library generation and a more detailed focus on library screening methods, which are critical to any directed evolution experiment.},

abstract = {The identification of maximally homologous subsequences among sets of long sequences is an important problem in tnolecular sequence analysis. The problem is straightforward only if one restricts consideration to cont.igucws subsequences (segments) containing no internal deletions or insertions. The more general problem has its solution in an extension of sequence metrics (Sellers 19i.i: IVaterman el al.. 1976) developed to measure the mininlunl number of "et-cntsr' required to convert one sequence into another. These developments in t.he modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithm of Seedleman {\&} Wunsch (1970) which first introduced an iterative matrix method of calculation. Sumerous other heuristic algorithms have been suggested including those of Fitch (1966) and Dayhoff (1969). More mathernat- icallg rigorous algorithms were suggested by Sankoff (1972), Reichert. ef d. (1973) and Beyer el d. (1979), but these were generally not biologically satisfjing or interpretable. Successcame with Sellers (19i4) development of a true metric measure of the distance betweef: sequences. This metric was later generalized by Waterman et al. (1976) to include deletions/insertions of arbitrary length. This metric represents the minimum number of "mutat.iona1 events'' required t,o convert one sequence into another. It is of interest to n0t.e that Smith et al. (1980) hare recently shown that under some conditions the original homology algorithm of Seedleman S. Wunsch (19iO). In this letter we extend the above ideas to find a pair of segments. one from each of two long sequences. such that there is no other pair of segments with greater similarity (homology). The similarity measure used here allows for arbitrary length deletions and insertions. =Ilgorithm},

@article{Kim2011,
abstract = {When expression of more than one gene is required in cells, bicistronic or multicistronic expression vectors have been used. Among various strategies employed to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size and difference in expression levels between genes before and after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage efficiency between genes upstream and downstream of the 2A peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii) comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various 2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in different contexts. Here, we generated four expression plasmids each harboring different 2A peptides derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus, equine rhinitis A virus, Thosea asigna virus and porcine teschovirus-1, respectively, and evaluated their cleavage efficiency in three commonly used human cell lines, zebrafish embryos and adult mice. Western blotting and confocal microscopic analyses revealed that among the four 2As, the one derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) has the highest cleavage efficiency in all the contexts examined. We anticipate that the 2A-harboring cloning vectors we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we demonstrated would help biomedical researchers easily adopt the 2A technology when bicistronic or multicistronic expression is required.},

abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

abstract = {The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) is a community-based bioinformatics project that classifies gene product function through the use of structured controlled vocabularies. A fundamental application of the Gene Ontology (GO) is in the creation of gene product annotations, evidence-based associations between GO definitions and experimental or sequence-based analysis. Currently, the GOC disseminates 126 million annotations covering {\textgreater}374,000 species including all the kingdoms of life. This number includes two classes of GO annotations: those created manually by experienced biocurators reviewing the literature or by examination of biological data (1.1 million annotations covering 2226 species) and those generated computationally via automated methods. As manual annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins within and between genomes, it is critical to provide accurate consistent manual annotations. Toward this goal, we present here the conventions defined by the GOC for the creation of manual annotation. This guide represents the best practices for manual annotation as established by the GOC project over the past 12 years. We hope this guide will encourage research communities to annotate gene products of their interest to enhance the corpus of GO annotations available to all.

abstract = {Small variations in nucleic acid sequences can have far-reaching phenotypic consequences. Reliably distinguishing closely related sequences is therefore important for research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that conditionally fluorescent DNA probes are capable of distinguishing variations of a single base in a stretch of target DNA. These probes use a novel programmable mechanism in which each single nucleotide polymorphism generates two thermodynamically destabilizing mismatch bubbles rather than the single mismatch formed during typical hybridization-based assays. Up to a 12,000-fold excess of a target that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism is required to generate the same fluorescence as one equivalent of the intended target, and detection works reliably over a wide range of conditions. Using these probes we detected point mutations in a 198 base-pair subsequence of the Escherichia coli rpoB gene. That our probes are constructed from multiple oligonucleotides circumvents synthesis limitations and enables long continuous DNA sequences to be probed.},

@article{Ghadessy2001,
abstract = {We describe compartmentalized self-replication (CSR), a strategy for the directed evolution of enzymes, especially polymerases. CSR is based on a simple feedback loop consisting of a polymerase that replicates only its own encoding gene. Compartmentalization serves to isolate individual self-replication reactions from each other. In such a system, adaptive gains directly (and proportionally) translate into genetic amplification of the encoding gene. CSR has applications in the evolution of polymerases with novel and useful properties. By using three cycles of CSR, we obtained variants of Taq DNA polymerase with 11-fold higher thermostability than the wild-type enzyme or with a {\textgreater}130-fold increased resistance to the potent inhibitor heparin. Insertion of an extra stage into the CSR cycle before the polymerase reaction allows its application to enzymes other than polymerases. We show that nucleoside diphosphate kinase and Taq polymerase can form such a cooperative CSR cycle based on reciprocal catalysis, whereby nucleoside diphosphate kinase produces the substrates required for the replication of its own gene. We also find that in CSR the polymerase genes themselves evolve toward more efficient replication. Thus, polymerase genes and their encoded polypeptides cooperate to maximize postselection copy number. CSR should prove useful for the directed evolution of enzymes, particularly DNA or RNA polymerases, as well as for the design and study of in vitro self-replicating systems mimicking prebiotic evolution and viral replication.},

abstract = {Transposons populate the landscape of all eukaryotic genomes. Often considered purely genomic parasites, transposons can also benefit their hosts, playing roles in gene regulation and in genome organization and evolution. Peaceful coexistence with mobile elements depends upon adaptive control mechanisms, since unchecked transposon activity can impact long-term fitness and acutely reduce the fertility of progeny. Here, we review the conserved roles played by small RNAs in the adaptation of eukaryotes to coexist with their genomic colonists. An understanding of transposon-defense pathways has uncovered recurring themes in the mechanisms by which genomes distinguish "self" from "non-self" and selectively silence the latter. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In all lines tested, butyrate caused hyperacetylation of H3 and H4, and in rat IRC8 cells, H2A and H2B were also affected. In Friend erythroleukemic cells, butyrate also induces the synthesis of a nonhistone chromosomal protein, IP25. Butyrate does not affect the rate of histone acetylation in cell-free extracts or nuclei of Friend cells. Rather, this fatty acid inhibits histone deacetylation. Cell-free extracts of either control cells or butyrate-grown cells contain comparable levels of histone-deacetylating activity. This in vitro activity is inhibited by the addition of butyrate to the extracts. Thus butyrate appears to be an inhibitor of histone deacetylases both in vivo and in vitro. {\textcopyright} 1978.},
