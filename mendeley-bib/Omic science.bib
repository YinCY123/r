abstract = {The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor $\beta$-catenin (Ctnnb1). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium-specific transcription factors (Foxf2, Foxl2, Foxq1, Lef1, Ppard, Zfp551, and Zic3) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of Foxf2, Foxq1, Ppard, or Zic3 transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of Foxf2 and Zic3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain barrier models.},

abstract = {XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu) is a cloud-based informatic platform designed to process and visualize mass-spectrometry-based, untargeted metabolomic data. Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the independent, "control" versus "disease" experimental design. Here, we introduce an enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated statistical tests cover a wide array of trnivariate analyses. Multigroup comparison allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS fiinctionalities is demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.},

@article{Wehrens2016,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION Batch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. OBJECTIVES This paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects. METHODS Batch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC-MS and GC-MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS The three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects-replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered. CONCLUSION The use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA has enabled deep and efficient probing of transcriptomes. Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

abstract = {Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) maps and analyzes transcriptomes and generates data on sequence variation in expressed genes. There are few reported studies on analysis strategies to maximize the yield of quality RNA-seq SNP data. We evaluated the performance of different SNP-calling methods following alignment to both genome and transcriptome by applying them to RNA-seq data from a HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line sample and comparing results with sequence variation data from 1000 Genomes. We determined that the best method to achieve high specificity and sensitivity, and greatest number of SNP calls, is to remove duplicate sequence reads after alignment to the genome and to call SNPs using SAMtools. The accuracy of SNP calls is dependent on sequence coverage available. In terms of specificity, 89{\%} of RNA-seq SNPs calls were true variants where coverage is {\textgreater}10X. In terms of sensitivity, at {\textgreater}10X coverage 92{\%} of all expected SNPs in expressed exons could be detected. Overall, the results indicate that RNA-seq SNP data are a very useful by-product of sequence-based transcriptome analysis. If RNA-seq is applied to disease tissue samples and assuming that genes carrying mutations relevant to disease biology are being expressed, a very high proportion of these mutations can be detected.},

To uncover dynamic biological mechanisms, bioinformatics tools have become essential to facilitating data interpretation in large-scale analyses. Global metabolomics is one such method for performing systems biology, as metabolites represent the downstream functional products of ongoing biological processes. We have developed XCMS Online, a platform that enables online metabolomics data processing and interpretation. A systems biology workflow recently implemented within XCMS Online enables rapid metabolic pathway mapping using raw metabolomics data for investigating dysregulated metabolic processes. In addition, this platform supports integration of multi-omic (such as genomic and proteomic) data to garner further systems-wide mechanistic insight. Here, we provide an in-depth procedure showing how to effectively navigate and use the systems biology workflow within XCMS Online without a priori knowledge of the platform, including uploading liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data from metabolite-extracted biological samples, defining the job parameters to identify features, correcting for retention time deviations, conducting statistical analysis of features between sample classes and performing predictive metabolic pathway analysis. Additional multi-omics data can be uploaded and overlaid with previously identified pathways to enhance systems-wide analysis of the observed dysregulations. We also describe unique visualization tools to assist in elucidation of statistically significant dysregulated metabolic pathways.

Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.

Despite the high research interest, identifying and characterizing the structure of metabo- lites has become amajor drawback for converting rawMS data into biological knowledge. Comprehensive and well-annotated MS-based spectral databases play a key role in serving this purpose via the forma- tion of metabolite annotations. The main characteristics of the mass spectral databases currently used in MS-based metabolomics are reviewed in this study, underlining their advantages and limitations. In addition, the overlap of compounds with MSn (n ≥ 2) spectra fromauthentic chemical standards in most public and commercial databases has been calculated for the first time. Finally, future prospects of mass spectral databases are discussed in terms of the needs posed by novel applications and instrumental advancements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an important analytical technology for e.g. metabolomics experiments. Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features - a reliable feature detection is mandatory.RESULTS:We developed a new feature detection algorithm "centWave" for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity. CONCLUSIONS:The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine. The centWave algorithm was integrated into the Bioconductor R-package XCMS and is available from http://www.bioconductor.org/.},

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.},

abstract = {Background: Various alterations in lipid metabolism have been observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives: To determine the levels of lipid species in plasma from CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients and test their association with CKD severity and patient outcome. Methods: Seventy-seven patients with CKD stage 2 to HD were grouped into classes of CKD severity at baseline and followed-up for 3.5 years for the occurrence of transition to HD or death (combined outcome). Plasma levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and fatty acids were analyzed by flow-injection analysis coupled to tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Kruskal Wallis rank tests and Cox regressions were used to analyze the association of lipids with CKD severity and the risk of combined outcome, respectively. Results: The plasma level of PCs, LPCs, and SMs was decreased in HD patients compared with nondialyzed CKD patients (all P {\textless}.05), whereas esterified and/or nonesterified fatty acids level did not change. Thirty-four lipids displayed significantly lower abundance in plasma of HD patients, whereas elaidic acid (C18:1$\omega$9t) level was increased (P {\textless}.001). The total amount of LPCs and individual LPCs were associated with better outcome (P {\textless}.05). In particular, LPC 18:2 and LPC 20:3 were statistically associated with outcome in adjusted models (P {\textless}.05). Discussion: In HD patients, a reduction in plasma lipids is observed. Some of the alterations, namely reduced LPCs, were associated with the risk of adverse outcome. These changes could be related to metabolic dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear. Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N(4)-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1$\beta$, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions.},

Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

OBJECTIVES The goal of this review is to help researchers use specific tools to aid their research and to develop new AS detection tools based on these previously established tools. METHOD We selected 15 AS detection tools that were recently published; we classified and delineated them on several aspects. Also, a performance comparison of these tools with the same starting input was conducted. RESULT We reviewed the following categorized features of the tools: Publication information, working principles, generic and distinct workflows, running platform, input data requirement, sequencing depth dependency, reads mapped to multiple locations, isoform annotation basis, precise detected AS types, and performance benchmarks. CONCLUSION Through comparisons of these tools, we provide a panorama of the advantages and short-comings of each tool and their scopes of application.},

abstract = {Supercentenarians, people who have reached 110 y of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35{\%} of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF-$\alpha$ upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Untargeted metabolomics generates a huge amount of data. Software packages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these data. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing.RESULTS:We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments.IPO optimizes XCMS peak picking parameters by using natural, stable 13C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak groups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups that show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models. IPO was tested on three different data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. IPO resulted in an increase of reliable groups (146{\%} - 361{\%}), a decrease of non-reliable groups (3{\%} - 8{\%}) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third.CONCLUSIONS:IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We were also able to show the potential of IPO to increase the reliability of metabolomics data.The source code is implemented in R, tested on Linux and Windows and it is freely available for download at https://github.com/glibiseller/IPO webcite. The training sets and test sets can be downloaded from https://health.joanneum.at/IPO webcite.},

To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking-immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

By using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of- flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS), hundreds to thousands of peaks with a unique retention time are routinely detected from most biological samples in an untargeted profiling m/z and experiment. Each peak, termed a metabolomic feature, can be characterized on the basis of its accurate mass, retention time, and tandem mass spectral fragmentation pattern. Here a 7-step protocol is suggested for such a characterization by using the METLIN metabolite database. The protocol starts from untargeted metabolomic LC-Q-ToF-MS data that has been analyzed with the bioinformatic program XCMS, and describes a strategy for selecting interesting features as well as performing subsequent targeted tandem mass spectrometry. The 7 steps described will require 2-4 hours to complete per feature, depending on the compound. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {The major cell classes of the brain differ in their developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, and function. To better understand the functions and interactions of the cell types that comprise these classes, we acutely purified representative populations of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these eight cell types by RNA sequencing and used a sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands of new cell type-enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, tools for genetic manipulation, and insights into the biology of the brain. For example, our data provide clues as to how neurons and astrocytes differ in their ability to dynamically regulate glycolytic flux and lactate generation attributable to unique splicing of PKM2, the gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. This dataset will provide a powerful new resource for understanding the development and function of the brain. To ensure the widespread distribution of these datasets, we have created a user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres{\_}lab/brain{\_}rnaseq.html) that provides a platform for analyzing and comparing transciption and alternative splicing profiles for various cell classes in the brain.},

However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

In combination with well-established metabolic RNA labeling protocols and coupled to standard, low-input, high-throughput RNA sequencing methods, SLAM seq enabled rapid access to RNA-polymerase-II-dependent gene expression dynamics in the context of total RNA. We validated the method in mouse embryonic stem cells by showing that the RNA-polymerase-II-dependent transcriptional output scaled with Oct4/Sox2/Nanog-defined enhancer activity, and we provide quantitative and mechanistic evidence for transcript-specific RNA turnover mediated by post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathways initiated by microRNAs and N6-methyladenosine.

In this neurodegeneration model, we discovered two molecularly distinct reactive microglia phenotypes that are typified by modules of co-regulated type I and type II interferon response genes, respectively. Furthermore, our work identified previously unobserved heterogeneity in the response of microglia to neurodegeneration, discovered disease stage-specific microglia cell states, revealed the trajectory of cellular reprogramming of microglia in response to neurodegeneration, and uncovered the underlying transcriptional programs. Mathys et al. use single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the phenotypic heterogeneity of microglia during the progression of neurodegeneration.

abstract = {Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing biological questions. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is widely used for metabolic characterization, including targeted and untargeted approaches. Despite recent innovations, a crucial aspect of this technique is the sample preparation for accurate data analyses. In this protocol, we present a robust and adaptable workflow for metabolic analyses of mammalian cells from adherent cell cultures, which is particularly suited for qualitative and quantitative central metabolite characterization by LC-MS. Each sample consists of 6,000,000 mammalian cells grown on cover glasses, allowing for fast and complete transfer of the cells for metabolite extraction or medium exchange, e.g., for labeling experiments. The sampling procedure includes a fast and efficient washing step in liquid flow in water, which reduces cross-contamination and matrix effects while minimizing perturbation of the metabolic steady state of the cells; it is followed by quenching cell metabolism. The latter is achieved by using a -20 °C cold methanol acetonitrile mixture acidified with formic acid, followed by freeze drying, metabolite extraction and LC-MS. The protocol requires 2 s for cell sampling until quenching, and the entire protocol takes a total of 1.5 h per sample when the provided nanoscale LC-MS method is applied.},

abstract = {The human transcriptome comprises {\textgreater}80. 000 protein-coding transcripts and the estimated number of proteins synthesized from these transcripts is in the range of 250. 000 to 1 million. These transcripts and proteins are encoded by less than 20. 000 genes, suggesting extensive regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational level. Here we review how RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have increased our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to alternative transcripts and their alternative translation. We highlight four different regulatory processes: alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and alternative translation initiation. We discuss their transcriptome-wide distribution, their impact on protein expression, their biological relevance, and the possible molecular mechanisms leading to their alternative regulation. We conclude with a discussion of the coordination and the interdependence of these four regulatory layers.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) recognize specific DNA sequences to control chromatin and transcription, forming a complex system that guides expression of the genome. Despite keen interest in understanding how TFs control gene expression, it remains challenging to determine how the precise genomic binding sites of TFs are specified and how TF binding ultimately relates to regulation of transcription. This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation. Knowing how and where transcription factors bind to the genome is crucial for understanding how they control gene expression. This Review looks at how human TFs are identified and the ways they interact with DNA sequences.},

abstract = {SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are ge-netic markers whose precise identification is a pre-requisite for association studies. Methods to iden-tify them are currently well developed for model species, but rely on the availability of a (good) reference genome, and therefore cannot be ap-plied to non-model species. They are also mostly tailored for whole genome (re-)sequencing experi-ments, whereas in many cases, transcriptome se-quencing can be used as a cheaper alternative which already enables to identify SNPs located in tran-scribed regions. In this paper, we propose a method that identifies, quantifies and annotates SNPs with-out any reference genome, using RNA-seq data only. Individuals can be pooled prior to sequencing, if not enough material is available from one individual. Us-ing pooled human RNA-seq data, we clarify the pre-cision and recall of our method and discuss them with respect to other methods which use a reference genome or an assembled transcriptome. We then val-idate experimentally the predictions of our method using RNA-seq data from two non-model species. The method can be used for any species to anno-tate SNPs and predict their impact on the protein se-quence. We further enable to test for the association of the identified SNPs with a phenotype of interest.},

abstract = {High-throughput transcriptomic profiling approaches have revealed that alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNAs, a fundamental process by which cells expand their transcriptomic diversity, is particularly widespread in the nervous system. AS events detected in the brain are more highly conserved than those detected in other tissues, suggesting that they more often provide conserved functions. Our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of neural AS events has significantly advanced with the coupling of various computational and experimental approaches. These studies indicate that dynamic regulation of AS in the nervous system is critical for modulating protein-protein interactions, transcription networks, and multiple aspects of neuronal development. Furthermore, several underappreciated classes of AS with the aforementioned roles in neuronal cells have emerged from unbiased, global approaches. Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing neural AS in order to gain new insight into pathways that may be altered in neurological diseases and disorders.},

abstract = {The potential for astrocyte participation in central nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons. Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted technical variation at several points in the experimental workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. RNA-Seq was used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in identical conditions. When differential expression threshold criteria of |log2 fold change| {\textgreater} 2 were applied to the data, no significant differences were observed. The technical component quantified variation arising from particular steps in the research pathway, and compared the ability of different normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10{\%} and a |log2 fold change| {\textgreater} 0.5 were implemented for the differential expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized and TMM-normalized data. The similarity in gene expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of normalization method influences the contributions to experimental variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the largest component of technical variance.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.},

This is the case for chemotaxonomy studies where common biosynthetic traits among species can be evidenced, but also for drug discovery purpose where such traits, in combination with bioactivity studies on extracts, may evidence bioactive molecules even before their isolation. One of the major bottlenecks of such studies remains the level of accuracy at which NPs can be identified. We discuss here the advancements in LC–MS and associated mining methods by addressing what would be ideal and what is achieved today. We propose future developments for reinforcing generic NPs databases both in the spectral and structural dimensions by heading towards a virtuous metabolite identification cycle allowing annotation of both known and unreported metabolites in an iterative manner.

abstract = {The diverse malignant, stromal, and immune cells in tumors affect growth, metastasis, and response to therapy. We profiled transcriptomes of ∼6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma highlights the heterogeneous composition of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment and associates a partial EMT program with metastasis.},

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42{\%} without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS2 data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS2 data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS2 data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS2 fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS2 spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS2 scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS2 fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS2 analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS2 spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS2 data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).},

abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature-feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called RAMClustR, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.},

abstract = {Alternative usage of transcript isoforms from the same gene has been hypothesized as an important feature in cancers. However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in RNA-seq data from {\textgreater}5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19{\%} of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of DNA sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other RNA-seq datasets.Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.

Following an exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured abundance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is often used for transcriptome profiling as well as the identification of novel transcripts and alternative splicing events. Typically, RNA-Seq libraries are prepared from total RNA using poly(A) enrichment of the mRNA (mRNA-Seq) to remove ribosomal RNA (rRNA), however, this method fails to capture non-poly(A) transcripts or partially degraded mRNAs. Hence, a mRNA-Seq protocol will not be compatible for use with RNAs coming from Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address the desire to perform RNA-Seq on FFPE materials, we evaluated two different library preparation protocols that could be compatible for use with small RNA fragments. We obtained paired Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE RNAs from multiple tumors and subjected these to different gene expression profiling methods. We tested 11 human breast tumor samples using: (a) FF RNAs by microarray, mRNA-Seq, Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq (Duplex-Specific Nuclease) and (b) FFPE RNAs by Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq. We also performed these different RNA-Seq protocols using 10 TCGA tumors as a validation set.The data from paired RNA samples showed high concordance in transcript quantification across all protocols and between FF and FFPE RNAs. In both FF and FFPE, Ribo-Zero-Seq removed rRNA with comparable efficiency as mRNA-Seq, and it provided an equivalent or less biased coverage on gene 3' ends. Compared to mRNA-Seq where 69{\%} of bases were mapped to the transcriptome, DSN-Seq and Ribo-Zero-Seq contained significantly fewer reads mapping to the transcriptome (20-30{\%}); in these RNA-Seq protocols, many if not most reads mapped to intronic regions. Approximately 14 million reads in mRNA-Seq and 45-65 million reads in Ribo-Zero-Seq or DSN-Seq were required to achieve the same gene detection levels as a standard Agilent DNA microarray.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that compared to mRNA-Seq and microarrays, Ribo-Zero-Seq provides equivalent rRNA removal efficiency, coverage uniformity, genome-based mapped reads, and consistently high quality quantification of transcripts. Moreover, Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq have consistent transcript quantification using FFPE RNAs, suggesting that RNA-Seq can be used with FFPE-derived RNAs for gene expression profiling.},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from 'regularized negative binomial regression', where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

abstract = {Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics, in which RNA species are identified and counted in situ via imaging, have emerged as a powerful complement to single-cell methods based on RNA sequencing of dissociated cells. These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.},

This includes vendor independent data standards such as mzML for mass spectrometry and nmrML for NMR raw data that have both enabled the development of advanced data processing algorithms by the scientific community. Standards such as ISA-Tab cover essential metadata, including the experimental design, the applied protocols, association between samples, data files and the experimental factors for further statistical analysis. Altogether, they pave the way for both reproducible research and data reuse, including meta-analyses. Further incentives to prepare standards compliant data sets include new opportunities to publish data sets, but also require a little "arm twisting" in the author guidelines of scientific journals to submit the data sets to public repositories such as the NIH Metabolomics Workbench or MetaboLights at EMBL-EBI. In the present article, we look at standards for data sharing, investigate their impact in metabolomics and give suggestions to improve their adoption.},

abstract = {Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab. org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution. With recent improvements in cost and throughput 1–3 , and the avail-ability of fully commercialized workflows 4 , high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics has become an accessible and powerful tool for unbi-ased profiling of complex and heterogeneous systems. In concert with novel computational approaches, these data sets can be used for the discovery of cell types and states 5,6 , the reconstruction of developmen-tal trajectories and fate decisions 7,8 , and to spatially model complex tis-sues 9,10 . Indeed, scRNA-seq is poised to transform our understanding of developmental biology and gene regulation 11–14 , and enable system-atic reconstruction of cellular taxonomies across the human body 6,15 , although substantial computational obstacles remain. In particular, integrated analysis of different scRNA-seq data sets, consisting of mul-tiple transcriptomic subpopulations, either to compare heterogeneous tissues across different conditions or to integrate measurements pro-duced by different technologies, remains challenging. Many powerful methods address individual components of this problem. For example, zero-inflated differential expression tests have been tailored to scRNA-seq data to identify changes within a single-cell type 16,17 , and clustering approaches 18–23 can detect proportional shifts across conditions if cell types are conserved. However, comparative analysis for scRNA-seq poses a unique challenge, as it is difficult to distinguish between changes in the proportional composition of cell types in a sample and expression changes within a given cell type, and simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets will confound these two disparate effects. Therefore, new methods are needed that can jointly analyze multiple data sets and facilitate comparative analysis down-stream. Progress toward this goal is essential for translating the oncom-ing wealth of single-cell sequencing data into biological insight. An integrated computational framework for joint learning between data sets would allow for robust and insightful comparisons of heterogene-ous tissues in health and disease, integration of data from diverse tech-nologies, and comparison of single-cell data from different species. Here, we present a novel computational strategy for integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data sets, motivated by techniques in com-puter vision designed for the alignment and integration of imaging data sets 24,25 . We demonstrate that multivariate methods designed for 'manifold alignment' 26,27 can be successfully applied to scRNA-seq data to identify gene–gene correlation patterns that are conserved across data sets and can embed cells in a shared low-dimensional space. We identify and compare 13 aligned peripheral blood mono-nuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations under resting and interferon $\beta$ (IFN-$\beta$)-stimulated conditions, align scRNA-seq data sets of com-plex tissues produced across multiple technologies, and jointly dis-cover shared cell types from droplet-based 'atlases' of human and mouse pancreatic tissue. These analyses pose distinct challenges for alignment, but in each case, we successfully integrate the data sets to obtain deeper biological insight than would be possible from inde-pendent analysis. Our approach can be applied to data sets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cells, is compatible with diverse profiling technologies, and is implemented as part of Seurat, an open-source R toolkit for single-cell genomics.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry proteomics typically relies upon analyzing outcomes of single analyses; however, comparing raw data across multiple experiments should enhance both peptide/protein identification and quantitation. In the absence of convincing tandem MS identifications, comparing peptide quantities between experiments (or fractions) requires the chromatographic alignment of MS signals. An extension of dynamic time warping (DTW), termed ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp), is presented and used to align a variety of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS) proteomics data sets. An algorithm to produce a bijective (one-to-one) function from DTW output is coupled with piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to produce a smooth warping function. Data sets were chosen to represent a broad selection of ESI-LC-MS alignment cases. High confidence, overlapping tandem mass spectra are used as standards to optimize and compare alignment parameters. We determine that Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of spectra similarity outperforms covariance, dot product, and Euclidean distance in its ability to produce correct alignments with optimal and suboptimal alignment parameters. We demonstrate the importance of penalizing gaps for best alignments. Using optimized parameters, we show that OBI-Warp produces alignments consistent with time standards across these data sets.

abstract = {Biological systems are increasingly being studied in a holistic manner, using omics approaches, to provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the diverse collection of cellular components. Among the omics approaches, metabolomics, which deals with the quantitative global profiling of small molecules or metabolites, is being used extensively to explore the dynamic response of living systems, such as organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms, under diverse physiological and pathological conditions. This technology is now used routinely in a number of applications, including basic and clinical research, agriculture, microbiology, food science, nutrition, pharmaceutical research, environmental science and the development of biofuels. Of the multiple analytical platforms available to perform such analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry have come to dominate, owing to the high resolution and large datasets that can be generated with these techniques. The large multidimensional datasets that result from such studies must be processed and analyzed to render this data meaningful. Thus, bioinformatics tools are essential for the efficient processing of huge datasets, the characterization of the detected signals, and to align multiple datasets and their features. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of the data processing tools available, and reviews a collection of recent reports on the topic. Data conversion, pre-processing, alignment, normalization and statistical analysis are introduced, with their advantages and disadvantages, and comparisons are made to guide the reader.},

abstract = {In brain, signaling mediated by cell adhesion molecules defines the identity and functional properties of synapses. The specificity of presynaptic and postsynaptic interactions that is presumably medi-ated by cell adhesion molecules suggests that there exists a logic that could explain neuronal connectivity at the molecular level. Despite its importance, however, the nature of such logic is poorly understood, and even basic parameters, such as the number, identity, and single-cell expression profiles of candidate synaptic cell adhesion molecules, are not known. Here, we devised a comprehensive list of genes involved in cell adhesion, and used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze their expression in electrophysiologically de-fined interneurons and projection neurons. We compared the cell type-specific expression of these genes with that of genes involved in transmembrane ion conductances (i.e., channels), exocytosis, and rho/rac signaling, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Using these data, we identified two independent, developmentally regu-lated networks of interacting genes encoding molecules involved in cell adhesion, exocytosis, and signal transduction. Our approach pro-vides a framework for a presumed cell adhesion and signaling code in neurons, enables correlating electrophysiological with molecular properties of neurons, and suggests avenues toward understanding synaptic specificity. synapse | cell adhesion | single cell | RNAseq T he brain's " connectivity code " is thought to confer exquisite specificity to brain circuits by dictating connectivity between different types of neurons. Although its existence has not yet been conclusively demonstrated, synaptic cell adhesion mole-cules likely comprise a large part of such a code (1–4). Cell ad-hesion molecules are encoded by ∼2{\%} of the genome and play central roles in all tissues. During brain development, precisely matching presynaptic and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule interactions likely guide synapse formation and specify the properties of synapses by activating signal transduction cascades and recruiting scaffolding molecules, receptors, and active-zone proteins; in addition, such interactions could provide structural support to synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms in-volved are not understood. Because cell adhesion molecule-based interactions likely code for synapse specificity in a com-binatorial fashion (2, 3), an important step toward gaining insight into these molecular mechanisms is to eliminate nonfunctional possibilities, which—to a great extent—can be done by examin-ing cell type-specific expression of these molecules. If cell adhesion molecules dictate synapse properties, then such differences must be clearly present in interneuron and py-ramidal cell classes, which have diverse synaptic properties. For example, within the hippocampal circuit, CA1 pyramidal (CA1-PYR) neurons receive convergent inputs from multiple, elec-trophysiologically distinct inhibitory interneurons within the hippocampus (5). Inhibitory inputs include synapses formed by fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking (RS) interneurons (ref. 6; for reviews, see refs. 7 and 8). We previously showed using sin-gle-cell transcriptional profiling in FS parvalbumin (PV)-and RS cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing GABAergic interneurons that},

To help fill this knowledge gap, we characterized 57,979 cells from healthy mouse kidneys by using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing. On the basis of gene expression patterns, we infer that inherited kidney diseases that arise from distinct genetic mutations but share the same phenotypic manifestation originate from the same differentiated cell type. We also found that the collecting duct in kidneys of adult mice generates a spectrum of cell types through a newly identified transitional cell. Computational cell trajectory analysis and in vivo lineage tracing revealed that intercalated cells and principal cells undergo transitions mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.},

abstract = {We used Bayesian regularized neural networks to model data on the MHC class II-binding affinity of peptides. Training data consisted of sequences and binding data for nonamer (nine amino acid) peptides. Independent test data consisted of sequences and binding data for peptides of length ≤25. We assumed that MHC class II-binding activity of peptides depends only on the highest ranked embedded nonamer and that reverse sequences of active nonamers are inactive. We also internally validated the models by using 30{\%} of the training data in an internal test set. We obtained robust models, with near identical statistics for multiple training runs. We determined how predictive our models were using statistical tests and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graphs (AROC). Most models gave training A ROC values close to 1.0 and test set AROC values {\textgreater}0.8. We also used both amino acid indicator variables (bin20) and property-based descriptors to generate models for MHC class II-binding of peptides. The property-based descriptors were more parsimonious than the indicator variable descriptors, making them applicable to larger peptides, and their design makes them able to generalize to unknown peptides outside of the training space. None of the external test data sets contained any of the nonamer sequences in the training sets. Consequently, the models attempted to predict the activity of truly unknown peptides not encountered in the training sets. Our models were well able to tackle the difficult problem of correctly predicting the MHC class II-binding activities of a majority of the test set peptides. Exceptions to the assumption that nonamer motif activities were invariant to the peptide in which they were embedded, together with the limited coverage of the test data, and the fuzziness of the classification procedure, are likely explanations for some misclassifications. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) provide a simple model for studying essential hypertension. Their genetic and metabolic features are of great interest because they may provide insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying essential hypertension. We have thus investigated the metabolic characteristics of SHR at various ages, covering the prehypertensive stage and the developmental phase of hypertension, using a (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomic approach. Twenty-four-hour urine samples from the SHR and their age-matched normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rats, were analyzed using (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and the spectral data were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) to find metabolic differences between the two strains. Consequently, it was possible to separate the urine samples between the two strains at any age ranging from 4 to 20 weeks in the principal component scores plots. The major spectral regions and signals (metabolites) contributing to the separation were picked up based on the loadings. Subsequently, the urinary excreted levels of metabolites highlighted by the PCA were compared based on the signal intensities corrected by urine volume and body weight. These investigations revealed the major metabolic changes characteristic of the SHR, which included differences in citrate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinate, hippurate, phenylacetylglycine, p-cresol glucuronide, creatine, taurine, medium-chain dicarboxylates (tentative), unknown ($\delta$ 3.11), and the regions at 3.60, 3.64, 3.68 and 3.88 p.p.m. The results supported the occurrence of metabolic acidosis in the SHR in the period of prehypertension as well as rapidly rising blood pressure. In addition, the intestinal microfloral populations in the SHR were suggested to be altered in the developmental phase of hypertension.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 17 November 2011; doi:10.1038/hr.2011.182.},

abstract = {We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility in ∼100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and ∼400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution. Profiling chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution across 13 tissues in mice identifies 85 distinct patterns and a catalog of ∼400,000 potential regulatory elements, presenting a resource for understanding the chromatin regulatory landscape of diverse mammalian cell types and for interpreting human genome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) profiles the chromatin accessibility landscape at single cell level, thus revealing cell-to-cell variability in gene regulation. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data often complicate the analysis. Here, we introduce a method for analyzing scATAC-seq data, called Single-Cell ATAC-seq analysis via Latent feature Extraction (SCALE). SCALE combines a deep generative framework and a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn latent features that accurately characterize scATAC-seq data. We validate SCALE on datasets generated on different platforms with different protocols, and having different overall data qualities. SCALE substantially outperforms the other tools in all aspects of scATAC-seq data analysis, including visualization, clustering, and denoising and imputation. Importantly, SCALE also generates interpretable features that directly link to cell populations, and can potentially reveal batch effects in scATAC-seq experiments.},

Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognized need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment. Software for the approach is made freely available.},

abstract = {The predominance of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) used to analyze metabolomics datasets (indeed, it is the most well-known tool to perform classification and regression in metabolomics), can be said to have led to the point that not all researchers are fully aware of alternative multivariate classification algorithms. This may in part be due to the widespread availability of PLS-DA in most of the well-known statistical software packages, where its implementation is very easy if the default settings are used. In addition, one of the perceived advantages of PLS-DA is that it has the ability to analyze highly collinear and noisy data. Furthermore, the calibration model is known to provide a variety of useful statistics, such as prediction accuracy as well as scores and loadings plots. However, this method may provide misleading results, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical validation, when used by non-experts who are not aware of its potential limitations when used in conjunction with metabolomics. This tutorial review aims to provide an introductory overview to several straightforward statistical methods such as principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA), support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF), which could very easily be used either to augment PLS or as alternative supervised learning methods to PLS-DA. These methods can be said to be particularly appropriate for the analysis of large, highly-complex data sets which are common output(s) in metabolomics studies where the numbers of variables often far exceed the number of samples. In addition, these alternative techniques may be useful tools for generating parsimonious models through feature selection and data reduction, as well as providing more propitious results. We sincerely hope that the general reader is left with little doubt that there are several promising and readily available alternatives to PLS-DA, to analyze large and highly complex data sets.},

There has been a recent development to replace spectral libraries by molecular structure databases when searching the MS/MS data of the unknown compound. Several tools have been developed for this task, including CFM-ID, MetFrag, MAGMa(+), FingerID and CSI:FingerID. These methods are already helpful for everyday metabolomics; with further advances, these methods can become indispensable tools for tomorrow's metabolomics. Here, I discuss several questions related to this task, such as: Why not wait for spectral libraries to grow sufficiently? Why evaluate methods outside their ‘comfort zone'?

abstract = {Variable selection on high throughput biological data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and, therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic structure. There are different ways to perform variable selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to identify differentially expressed features for explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. A simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework. sPLS-DA has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs. sPLS-DA is available in the R package mixOmics, which is dedicated to the analysis of large biological data sets.},

We developed an alternative approach, called ‘ZipSeq', that uses patterned illumination and photocaged oligonucleotides to serially print barcodes (Zipcodes) onto live cells within intact tissues, in real-time and with on-the-fly selection of patterns. Using ZipSeq, we mapped gene expression in three settings: in-vitro wound healing, live lymph node sections and in a live tumor microenvironment (TME). In all cases, we discovered new gene expression patterns associated with histological structures. In the TME, this demonstrated a trajectory of myeloid and T cell differentiation, from periphery inward. A variation of ZipSeq efficiently scales to the level of single cells, providing a pathway for complete mapping of live tissues, subsequent to real-time imaging or perturbation.},

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA, the diversity of AS transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events has ever grown since, novel isoforms are commonly observed when working with less annotated organisms, in the context of diseases, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete isoforms is technically challenging or expensive, focussing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful for differential analyses. Results: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences.

abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biologic samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biologic studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biologic samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biologic study.},

abstract = {Tissue-resident macrophages support embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and repair. The mechanisms that control their differentiation remain unclear. We report here that erythro-myeloid progenitors in mice generate premacrophages (pMacs) that simultaneously colonize the whole embryo from embryonic day 9.5 in a chemokine-receptor-dependent manner. The core macrophage program initiated in pMacs is rapidly diversified as expression of transcriptional regulators becomes tissue-specific in early macrophages. This process appears essential for macrophage specification and maintenance, as inactivation of Id3 impairs the development of liver macrophages and results in selective Kupffer cell deficiency in adults. We propose that macrophage differentiation is an integral part of organogenesis, as colonization of organ anlagen by pMacs is followed by their specification into tissue macrophages, hereby generating the macrophage diversity observed in postnatal tissues.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes harbor millions of noncoding elements called enhancers that quantitatively regulate gene expression, but it remains unclear which enhancers regulate which genes. Here we describe an experimental approach, based on CRISPR interference, RNA FISH, and flow cytometry (CRISPRi-FlowFISH), to perturb enhancers in the genome, and apply it to test {\textgreater}3,000 potential regulatory enhancer-gene connections across multiple genomic loci. A simple equation based on a mechanistic model for enhancer function performed remarkably well at predicting the complex patterns of regulatory connections we observe in our CRISPR dataset. This Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model involves multiplying measures of enhancer activity and enhancer-promoter 3D contacts, and can predict enhancer-gene connections in a given cell type based on chromatin state maps. Together, CRISPRi-FlowFISH and the ABC model provide a systematic approach to map and predict which enhancers regulate which genes, and will help to interpret the functions of the thousands of disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.},

abstract = {The kidney harbours different types of endothelia, each with specific structural and functional characteristics. The glomerular endothelium, which is highly fenestrated and covered by a rich glycocalyx, participates in the sieving properties of the glomerular filtration barrier and in the maintenance of podocyte structure. The microvascular endothelium in peritubular capillaries, which is also fenestrated, transports reabsorbed components and participates in epithelial cell function. The endothelium of large and small vessels supports the renal vasculature. These renal endothelia are protected by regulators of thrombosis, inflammation and complement, but endothelial injury (for example, induced by toxins, antibodies, immune cells or inflammatory cytokines) or defects in factors that provide endothelial protection (for example, regulators of complement or angiogenesis) can lead to acute or chronic renal injury. Moreover, renal endothelial cells can transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype, favouring renal fibrosis and the development of chronic kidney disease. Thus, the renal endothelium is both a target and a driver of kidney and systemic cardiovascular complications. Emerging therapeutic strategies that target the renal endothelium may lead to improved outcomes for both rare and common renal diseases.},

The use of powerful analytical techniques (e.g., high-resolution mass spectrometry) provides high-dimensional data, often with noisy and collinear structures. Such amount of information-rich mass spectrometry data requires extensive processing in order to handle metabolomic data sets appropriately and to further assess sample classification/discrimination and biomarker discovery. This review shows the steps involved in the data analysis workflow for both targeted and untargeted metabolomic studies. Especial attention is focused on the distinct methodologies that have been developed in the last decade for the untargeted case. Furthermore, some powerful and recent alternatives based on the use of chemometric tools will also be discussed. In general terms, this review helps researchers to critically explore the distinct alternatives for LC-MS metabolomic data analysis to better choose the most appropriate for their case study.},

As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.},

abstract = {Antibody Modeling Assessment II (AMA-II) provided an opportunity to benchmark RosettaAntibody on a set of 11 unpublished antibody structures. RosettaAntibody produced accurate, physically realistic models, with all framework regions and 42 of the 55 non-H3 CDR loops predicted to under an {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m. The performance is notable when modeling H3 on a homology framework, where RosettaAntibody produced the best model among all participants for four of the 11 targets, two of which were predicted with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m accuracy. To improve RosettaAntibody, we pursued the causes of model errors. The most common limitation was template unavailability, underscoring the need for more antibody structures and/or better de novo loop methods. In some cases, better templates could have been found by considering residues outside of the CDRs. De novo CDR H3 modeling remains challenging at long loop lengths, but constraining the C-terminal end of H3 to a kinked conformation allows near-native conformations to be sampled more frequently. We also found that incorrect VL -VH orientations caused models with low H3 RMSDs to score poorly, suggesting that correct VL -VH orientations will improve discrimination between near-native and incorrect conformations. These observations will guide the future development of RosettaAntibody. Proteins 2014; 82:1611-1623. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here we present genome-wide comparisons of chromatin accessibility and gene expression from endogenous CD8 + T cells responding to acute and chronic viral infection using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq techniques. Acquisition of effector, memory, or exhausted phenotypes was associated with stable changes in chromatin accessibility away from the naive T cell state.

abstract = {In the problems of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), the objective is to associate subsequences of individuals' genomes to the observable characteristics called phenotypes. The genome containing the biological information of an individual can be represented by a sequence of length {\$}G{\$}. Many observable characteristics of individuals can be related to a subsequence of a given length {\$}L{\$} called causal subsequence. The environmental affects make the relation between the causal subsequence and the observable characteristics a stochastic function. Our objective in this paper is to detect the causal subsequence of a specific phenotype using a dataset of {\$}N{\$} individuals and their observed characteristics. We introduce an abstract formulation of GWAS which allows us to investigate the problem from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, as the parameters {\$}N,G,{\$} and {\$}L{\$} grow, we observe a threshold effect at {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}Gh(L/G){\}}{\{}N{\}}{\$}, where {\$}h(.){\$} is the binary entropy function. This effect allows us to define the capacity of recovering the causal subsequence by denoting the rate of the GWAS problem as {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}Gh(L/G){\}}{\{}N{\}}{\$}. We develop an achievable scheme and a matching converse for this problem, and thus characterize its capacity in two scenarios: the zero-error-rate and the {\$}\backslashepsilon-{\$}error-rate.},

In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular helper cell development.

abstract = {Global profiling of metabolites in biological samples by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry results in datasets too large to evaluate manually. Fortunately, a variety of software programs are now available to automate the data analysis. Selection of the appropriate processing solution is dependent upon experimental design. Most metabolomic studies a decade ago had a relatively simple experimental design in which the intensities of compounds were compared between only two sample groups. More recently, however, increasingly sophisticated applications have been pursued. Examples include comparing compound intensities between multiple sample groups and unbiasedly tracking the fate of specific isotopic labels. The latter types of applications have necessitated the development of new software programs, which have introduced additional functionalities that facilitate data analysis. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the freely available bioinformatic solutions that are either based upon or are compatible with the algorithms in XCMS, which we broadly refer to here as the 'XCMS family' of software. These include CAMERA, credentialing, Warpgroup, metaXCMS, X13CMS, and XCMS Online. Together, these informatic technologies can accommodate most cutting-edge metabolomic applications and offer unique advantages when compared to the original XCMS program.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is routinely used for metabolomics experiments. In contrast to the fairly routine and automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form a major bottleneck in data interpretation. Here we present CAMERA, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7{\%} and 90.3{\%} of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We demonstrate the utility of CAMERA in two different, easily adoptable plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of CAMERA drastically reduced the amount of manual analysis.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications such as carbon 5 methylation of the cytosine base in a CpG dinucleotide context are involved in the onset and progression of human diseases. A comprehensive understanding of the role of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, the methylome, requires quantitative determination of the methylation states of all CpG sites in a genome. So far, analyses of the complete methylome by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) are rare because of the required large DNA quantities, substantial bioinformatic resources and high sequencing costs. Here we describe a detailed protocol for tagmentation-based WGBS (T-WGBS) and demonstrate its reliability in comparison with conventional WGBS. In T-WGBS, a hyperactive Tn5 transposase fragments the DNA and appends sequencing adapters in a single step. T-WGBS requires not more than 20 ng of input DNA; hence, the protocol allows the comprehensive methylome analysis of limited amounts of DNA isolated from precious biological specimens. The T-WGBS library preparation takes 2 d. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.

We proved that compared with cDNA microarray technique, our single-cell cDNA SOLiD sequencing assay can detect expression of thousands of more genes. Moreover, for the genes detected by microarray and SOLiD sequencing, our assay detected new transcript variants for a large proportion of them, which confirms unambiguously at single-cell resolution that the transcriptome complexity is higher than expected traditionally. Finally, by using our assay to Dicer knockout (KO) and Ago2 KO oocytes, we showed that a significant amount of transposons were up-regulated abnormally in Dicer/Ago2 KO mature oocytes compared with wild-type controls.},

abstract = {? 2014, The Author(s).Phenotyping of 1,200 ?healthy? adults from the UK has been performed through the investigation of diverse classes of hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites present in serum by applying a series of chromatography?mass spectrometry platforms. These data were made robust to instrumental drift by numerical correction; this was prerequisite to allow detection of subtle metabolic differences. The variation in observed metabolite relative concentrations between the 1,200 subjects ranged from less than 5?{\%} to more than 200?{\%}. Variations in metabolites could be related to differences in gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, and smoking. Investigations suggest that a sample size of 600 subjects is both necessary and sufficient for robust analysis of these data. Overall, this is a large scale and non-targeted chromatographic MS-based metabolomics study, using samples from over 1,000 individuals, to provide a comprehensive measurement of their serum metabolomes. This work provides an important baseline or reference dataset for understanding the ?normal? relative concentrations and variation in the human serum metabolome. These may be related to our increasing knowledge of the human metabolic network map. Information on the Husermet study is available at http://www.husermet.org/.

To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples.

abstract = {Urine has long been a "favored" biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes, largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another 2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies. An online database containing the complete set of 2651 confirmed human urine metabolite species, their structures (3079 in total), concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.urinemetabolome.ca.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not. This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets. Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.},

abstract = {The high-dimensional data created by high-throughput technologies require visualization tools that reveal data structure and patterns in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure using an information-geometric distance between data points. We compare PHATE to other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data, including continual progressions, branches and clusters, better than other tools. We define a manifold preservation metric, which we call denoised embedding manifold preservation (DEMaP), and show that PHATE produces lower-dimensional embeddings that are quantitatively better denoised as compared to existing visualization methods. An analysis of a newly generated single-cell RNA sequencing dataset on human germ-layer differentiation demonstrates how PHATE reveals unique biological insight into the main developmental branches, including identification of three previously undescribed subpopulations. We also show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of data types, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, Hi-C and gut microbiome data.},

Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. These data reveal genetic risk loci of cancer predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in cancer, identify gene-regulatory interactions underlying cancer immune evasion, and pinpoint noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in cancer to advance diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Deciphering cis -regulation, the code by which transcription factors (TFs) interpret regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression levels, is a long-standing challenge. Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94{\%} of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89{\%} from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis -regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cis -regulatory logic.},

Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than 400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse cell atlas (MCA). We reveal a single-cell hierarchy for many tissues that have not been well characterized previously. We built a web-based “single-cell MCA analysis” pipeline that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression. Our study demonstrates the wide applicability of the Microwell-seq technology and MCA resource.

Here we map the transcriptional landscape of mouse bone marrow vascular, perivascular and osteoblast cell populations at single-cell resolution, both at homeostasis and under conditions of stress-induced haematopoiesis. This analysis revealed previously unappreciated levels of cellular heterogeneity within the bone marrow niche and resolved cellular sources of pro-haematopoietic growth factors, chemokines and membrane-bound ligands. Our studies demonstrate a considerable transcriptional remodelling of niche elements under stress conditions, including an adipocytic skewing of perivascular cells. Among the stress-induced changes, we observed that vascular Notch delta-like ligands (encoded by Dll1 and Dll4) were downregulated. In the absence of vascular Dll4, haematopoietic stem cells prematurely induced a myeloid transcriptional program. These findings refine our understanding of the cellular architecture of the bone marrow niche, reveal a dynamic and heterogeneous molecular landscape that is highly sensitive to stress and illustrate the utility of single-cell transcriptomic data in evaluating the regulation of haematopoiesis by discrete niche populations.},

We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. implementations of the method are available at https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.},

We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

This breadth of data enable variance components analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, pinpointing specific cis-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Overall, this cis-regulatory atlas provides a trove of information on transcriptional regulation through immune differentiation and a foundational scaffold to define key regulatory events throughout the immunological genome.},

However, although many thousands of alternatively spliced transcripts are routinely detected in RNA-seq studies, reliable large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses identify only a small fraction of annotated alternative isoforms.

Indeed, most alternative exons do not seem to be under selective pressure, suggesting that a large majority of predicted alternative transcripts may not even be translated into proteins.},

In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

abstract = {Modifications of genes and proteins have been extensively studied in systems biology using comprehensive analytical strategies. Although metabolites are frequently modified, these modifications have not been studied using -omics approaches. Here a general strategy for the nontargeted profiling of modified metabolites, which we call "nontargeted modification-specific metabolomics", is reported. A key aspect of this strategy was the combination of in-source collision-induced dissociation liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and global nontargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics. Characteristic neutral loss fragments that are specific for acetylation, sulfation, glucuronidation, glucosidation, or ribose conjugation were reproducibly detected using human urine as a model specimen for method development. The practical application of this method was demonstrated by profiling urine samples from liver cirrhosis patients. Approximately 900 features were identified as modified endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. Moreover, this strategy supports the identification of compounds not included in traditional metabolomics databases (HMDB, Metlin, and KEGG), which are currently referred to as "unknowns" in metabolomics projects. Nontargeted modification-specific metabolomics opens a new perspective in systems biology.},

@article{Olivon2017,
abstract = {Molecular networking is becoming more and more popular into the metabolomic community to organize tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data. Even though this approach allows the treatment and comparison of large data sets, several drawbacks related to the MS-Cluster tool routinely used on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) limit its potential. MS-Cluster cannot distinguish between chromatography well-resolved isomers as retention times are not taken into account. Annotation with predicted chemical formulas is also not implemented and semiquantification is only based on the number of MS 2 scans. We propose to introduce a data-preprocessing workflow including the preliminary data treatment by MZmine 2 followed by a homemade Python script freely available to the community that clears the major previously mentioned GNPS drawbacks. The efficiency of this workflow is exemplified with the analysis of six fractions of increasing polarities obtained from a sequential supercritical CO 2 extraction of Stillingia lineata leaves. A mong the several mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflows recently developed, 1,2 Molecular Networking (MN) has appeared as a promising approach to dereplicate complex natural product mixtures. 3 This tool is becoming a standard for metabolomics analysis and gathers together a community of nearly 10000 users from 100 countries. MN significantly facilitates the tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data classification by organizing spectra sharing homologous fragmentations into a user-friendly visual representation. Assuming that similar molecules share similar fragmentation patterns, structurally related compounds are prone to cluster together within a network. Unlike many other dereplication strategies, MN has the unique advantage to identify known compounds through the integration of authentic standards or comparison with spectral libraries, but also to target unknown analogues more efficiently. Thus, standard MS 2 data act as "structural landmarks", enabling the annotation of related clusters of spectra. Despite valuable outputs, some improvements are still required to generate unambiguous molecular networks. Initially developed for proteomics purposes, the MS-Cluster algorithm implemented on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) platform was developed for the identification of redundant spectra from a same peptide and their replacement with a single averaged spectrum. 4 Based on the premise that occurrence of truly isobaric peptides eluting at different retention times (RTs) in liquid chromatography (LC) is rather uncommon in proteomics, MS-Cluster developers did not integrate RT information for restricted clustering over limited RT ranges. However, in metabolomics samples, the separation of isomers is common. By activating the MS-Cluster option, groups of isomers will ineluctably gather together within the same nodes leading to merge MS 2 data unexpectedly. Furthermore, GNPS quantification system simply relies on the number of MS 2 spectra detected for each precursor ion. This method is highly dependent on the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode parameters (number of precursor ions per scan, ion intensity threshold, exclusion rules). Thus, GNPS quantification only leads to a rough approximation of relative or absolute abundances. Finally, annotation of molecular networks by molecular formula generated from any commercial or freely available algorithm is not currently implemented. In the meantime, to face the increasing amount of data generated by untargeted LC-MS analyses of complex mixtures, numerous free software suites, such as XCMS, 5 MetaboAna-lyst, 6 OpenMS, 7 MaxQuant, 8 or SMART, 9 have been developed. These programs include sophisticated computational pipelines that typically consist of peak picking, integration, linear or nonlinear alignment, and normalization steps in order to extract meaningful information. Among them, MZmine 2 is one of the most popular and user-friendly software packages for metabolomics. 10 Its motivation is to propose straightforward operations for nonexpert users and a flexible and modular platform for MS data processing.},

In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89-0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses.

abstract = {Elucidation of regulatory networks, including identification of regulatory mechanisms specific to a given biological context, is a key aim in systems biology. This has motivated the move from co-expression to differential co-expression analysis and numerous methods have been developed subsequently to address this task; however, evaluation of methods and interpretation of the resulting networks has been hindered by the lack of known context-specific regulatory interactions. In this study, we develop a simulator based on dynamical systems modelling capable of simulating differential co-expression patterns. With the simulator and an evaluation framework, we benchmark and characterise the performance of inference methods. Defining three different levels of “true” networks for each simulation, we show that accurate inference of causation is difficult for all methods, compared to inference of associations. We show that a z-score-based method has the best general performance. Further, analysis of simulation parameters reveals five network and simulation properties that explained the performance of methods. The evaluation framework and inference methods used in this study are available in the dcanr R/Bioconductor package. Our analysis of networks inferred from simulated data show that hub nodes are more likely to be differentially regulated targets than transcription factors. Based on this observation, we propose an interpretation of the inferred differential network that can reconstruct a putative causal network.},

Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16{\%}-21{\%} of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions.

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions. TFs likewise underlie many different aspects of human physiology, disease, and variation, highlighting the importance of continued effort to understand TF-mediated gene regulation.

A fundamental application of the Gene Ontology (GO) is in the creation of gene product annotations, evidence-based associations between GO definitions and experimental or sequence-based analysis. Currently, the GOC disseminates 126 million annotations covering {\textgreater}374,000 species including all the kingdoms of life. This number includes two classes of GO annotations: those created manually by experienced biocurators reviewing the literature or by examination of biological data (1.1 million annotations covering 2226 species) and those generated computationally via automated methods. As manual annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins within and between genomes, it is critical to provide accurate consistent manual annotations. Toward this goal, we present here the conventions defined by the GOC for the creation of manual annotation. This guide represents the best practices for manual annotation as established by the GOC project over the past 12 years. We hope this guide will encourage research communities to annotate gene products of their interest to enhance the corpus of GO annotations available to all.

In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in 'splicing programs', which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Today it is possible to obtain genome-wide transcriptome data from single cells using high-throughput sequencing (scRNA-seq). The main advantage of scRNA-seq is that the cellular resolution and the genome wide scope makes it possible to address issues that are intractable using other methods, e.g. bulk RNA-seq or single-cell RT-qPCR. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will discuss some of the questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq as well as the available computational and statistical methods avialable. The course is taught through the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics training unit, but the material found on these pages is meant to be used for anyone interested in learning about computational analysis of scRNA-seq data. The course is taught twice per year and the material here is updated prior to each event. The number of computational tools is increasing rapidly and we are doing our best to keep up to date with what is available. One of the main constraints for this course is that we would like to use tools that are implemented in R and that run reasonably fast. Moreover, we will also confess to being somewhat biased towards methods that have been developed either by us or by our friends and colleagues.},

Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

This article looks at the dual problem of annotating peaks in a sample with a metabolite, together with putatively annotating whether a metabolite is present in the sample. The starting point of the approach is a Bayesian clustering of peaks into groups, each corresponding to putative adducts and isotopes of a single metabolite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Bayesian modelling introduced here combines information from the mass-to-charge ratio, retention time and intensity of each peak, together with a model of the inter-peak dependency structure, to increase the accuracy of peak annotation. The results inherently contain a quantitative estimate of confidence in the peak annotations and allow an accurate trade-off between precision and recall. Extensive validation experiments using authentic chemical standards show that this system is able to produce more accurate putative identifications than other state-of-the-art systems, while at the same time giving a probabilistic measure of confidence in the annotations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software has been implemented as part of the mzMatch metabolomics analysis pipeline, which is available for download at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/.},

However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite having well defined markers to identify these cells in mice, technical limitations have prevented identification of a similar cell type across species. The inability to identify resident macrophage populations across species hinders the translation of data obtained from animal model to human patients. METHODS As an entry point to determine novel markers that could identify resident macrophages across species, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis of all T and B cell-negative CD45+ innate immune cells in mouse, rat, pig, and human kidney tissue. RESULTS We identified genes with enriched expression in mouse renal resident macrophages that were also present in candidate resident macrophage populations across species. Using the scRNAseq data, we defined a novel set of possible cell surface markers (Cd74 and Cd81) for these candidate kidney resident macrophages. We confirmed, using parabiosis and flow cytometry, that these proteins are indeed enriched in mouse resident macrophages. Flow cytometry data also indicated the existence of a defined population of innate immune cells in rat and human kidney tissue that coexpress CD74 and CD81, suggesting the presence of renal resident macrophages in multiple species. CONCLUSIONS Based on transcriptional signatures, our data indicate that there is a conserved population of innate immune cells across multiple species that have been defined as resident macrophages in the mouse. Further, we identified potential cell surface markers to allow for future identification and characterization of this candidate resident macrophage population in mouse, rat, and pig translational studies.},

abstract = {Untargeted analysis performed using full-scan mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used in metabolomics. Although they are commonly employed, full-scan MS methods such as quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS have been restricted by various factors including their limited linear range and complicated data processing. LC coupled with triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is the gold standard for metabolite quantification; however, only known metabolites are generally quantified, limiting its applications in metabolomic analysis. In this study, a pseudotargeted approach was proposed to perform serum metabolomic analysis using an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/QQQ MS system operated in the MRM mode, for which the MRM ion pairs were acquired from the serum samples through untargeted tandem MS using UHPLC/Q-TOF MS. The UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted method displayed better repeatability and wider linear range than the traditional UHPLC/Q-TOF MS-based untargeted metabolomics method, and no complicated peak alignment was required. The developed method was applied to discover serum biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC had decreased lysophosphatidylcholine, increased long-chain and decreased medium-chain acylcarnitines, and increased aromatic and decreased branched-chain amino acid levels compared to healthy controls. The novelty of this work is that it provides an approach to acquire MRM ion pairs from real samples, is not limited to metabolite standards, and it provides a foundation to achieve pseudotargeted metabolomic analysis on the widely used LC/QQQ MS platform.},

abstract = {Microglia are myeloid cells of the CNS that participate both in normal CNS function and in disease. We investigated the molecular signature of microglia and identified 239 genes and 8 microRNAs that were uniquely or highly expressed in microglia versus myeloid and other immune cells. Of the 239 genes, 106 were enriched in microglia as compared with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. This microglia signature was not observed in microglial lines or in monocytes recruited to the CNS, and was also observed in human microglia. We found that TGF-$\beta$ was required for the in vitro development of microglia that express the microglial molecular signature characteristic of adult microglia and that microglia were absent in the CNS of TGF-$\beta$1-deficient mice. Our results identify a unique microglial signature that is dependent on TGF-$\beta$ signaling and provide insights into microglial biology and the possibility of targeting microglia for the treatment of CNS disease.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The consumption of high amounts of fructose is associated with metabolic diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Objective: To determine the effects of high fructose intake on plasma metabolomics. Study design: We enrolled 12 healthy volunteers (six lean and six obese women, age 24–35 years) in a crossover intervention study. All participants carried out three diets: (1) low fructose ({\textless}10 g/day); (2) high fructose (100 g/day) from natural food sources (fruit); and (3) high fructose (100 g/day) from high fructose syrup (HFS). Outcome measures: The primary outcome was changes in plasma metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics. Results: High compared to low fructose diets caused a marked metabolite class separation, especially because of changes in acylcarnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine levels. Both high fructose diets resulted in a decrease in mean acylcarnitine levels in all subjects, and an increase in mean lysophosphatidylcholine and diacyl-phosphatidylcholine levels in obese individuals. Medium chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with serum levels of liver enzymes and with the fatty liver index. Discussion: The metabolic shifts induced by high fructose consumption suggest an inhibition of mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation and an increase in lipid peroxidation. The effects tended to be more pronounced following the HFS than the fruit diet.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We focus on the analysis of water-soluble primary metabolites, which carry the majority of metabolic flux in living organisms. We show how seemingly straightforward sample preparation methods can introduce systematic errors (e.g., due to interconversion among metabolites) and how proper selection of quenching solvent (e.g. acidic acetonitrile: methanol: water) can mitigate such problems. We discuss each common analytical platform (LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR, and enzyme assays) with a focus on its specific pitfalls and how to avoid them. In so doing, we provide the knowledge base for carrying out biologically informative metabolite measurements.},

We implemented a quantitative polar metabolomics profiling platform using selected reaction monitoring with a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that covers all major metabolic pathways. The platform uses hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive/negative ion switching to analyze 258 metabolites (289 Q1/Q3 transitions) from a single 15-min liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition with a 3-ms dwell time and a 1.55-s duty cycle time. Previous platforms use more than one experiment to profile this number of metabolites from different ionization modes. The platform is compatible with polar metabolites from any biological source, including fresh tissues, cancer cells, bodily fluids and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Relative quantification can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total ion current can be used for statistical analyses and pathway analyses across biological sample conditions. The procedure takes approximately 12 h from metabolite extraction to peak integration for a data set containing 15 total samples ( approximately 6 h for a single sample).},

Although software has been introduced to annotate spectral degeneracy, current approaches are unable to represent several important classes of peak relationships. These include heterodimers and higher complex adducts, distal fragments, relationships between peaks in different polarities, and complex adducts between features and background peaks.

Although recent development of next generation sequencing technology suggests RNA-seq as a fast and accurate method for obtaining transcriptomic profiles, few studies have been conducted to investigate best RNA-seq quantification methods that yield the optimum linear space for deconvolution analysis. Using a benchmark RNA-seq dataset, we investigated the linearity of abundance estimated from seven most popular RNA-seq quantification methods both at the gene and isoform levels. Linearity is evaluated through parameter estimation, concordance analysis and residual analysis based on a multiple linear regression model. Results show that count data gives poor parameter estimations, large intercepts and high inter-sample variability; while TPM value from Kallisto and Salmon shows high linearity in all analyses. Salmon and Kallisto TPM data gives the best fit to the linear model studied.

Such data sets have the addnl. characteristic that they allow a more robust assessment of detection signal quality for each metabolite. Using our method, almost 80{\%} of the recorded signals can be discarded as uninformative, while important information is retained. As a consequence, we obtain a broader understanding of the information content of our analyses and a better assessment of the metabolites detected in the analyzed data sets. We illustrate the applicability of this method using std. mixts., as well as cell exts. from bacterial samples. It is evident that this method can be applied in many types of LC-MS analyses and more specifically in untargeted metabolomics. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differen- tiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell–cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells (PIC-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells (PICs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using computational modeling, PIC-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply PIC-seq to inter- rogate diverse interactions including immune–epithelial PICs in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell–DC interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with DCs in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell–DC pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory DCs and T cells. PIC-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.},

Through exome analysis, we found BAP1, NF2, TP53, SETD2, DDX3X, ULK2, RYR2, CFAP45, SETDB1 and DDX51 to be significantly mutated (q-score ≥ 0.8) in MPMs. We identified recurrent mutations in several genes, including SF3B1 (∼2{\%}; 4/216) and TRAF7 (∼2{\%}; 5/216). SF3B1-mutant samples showed a splicing profile distinct from that of wild-type tumors. TRAF7 alterations occurred primarily in the WD40 domain and were, except in one case, mutually exclusive with NF2 alterations. We found recurrent gene fusions and splice alterations to be frequent mechanisms for inactivation of NF2, BAP1 and SETD2. Through integrated analyses, we identified alterations in Hippo, mTOR, histone methylation, RNA helicase and p53 signaling pathways in MPMs.},

All samples were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic method for metabolic profiling. A pragmatic approach combining several well-established statistical methods was developed for processing this large data set in order to detect small differences in metabolic profiles in combination with a large biological variation. Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models. After several data preprocessing steps, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for finding biomarkers. To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation. The strategy proposed proved to be applicable for dealing with large-scale human metabolomics studies.},

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

One particular challenge is the analysis of single-cell time course datasets: how to identify unique cell populations and track how they change across time points. To facilitate this analysis, we developed FLOW-MAP, a graphical user interface (GUI)-based software tool that uses graph layout analysis with sequential time ordering to visualize cellular trajectories in high-dimensional single-cell datasets obtained from flow cytometry, mass cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments. Here we provide a detailed description of the FLOW-MAP algorithm and how to use the open-source R package FLOWMAPR via its GUI or with text-based commands. This approach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell differentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug resistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a step-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a previously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other single-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the FLOW-MAP approach.

Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The field of metabolomics has expanded greatly over the past two decades, both as an experimental science with applications in many areas, as well as in regards to data standards and bioinformatics software tools. The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software tools. OBJECTIVES To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and tools that are used primarily in metabolomics. METHODS The most widely used tools were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the tool being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Tools were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. LC-MS, GC-MS or NMR) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. RESULTS A comprehensive list of the most used tools was compiled. Each tool is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable tools of the same domain. An extended list including additional tools is available at https://github.com/RASpicer/MetabolomicsTools which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. CONCLUSION This review presents the most widely used tools for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality. As future work, we suggest a direct comparison of tools' abilities to perform specific data analysis tasks e.g. peak picking.},

abstract = {Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.},

abstract = {Forensic and clinical toxicological screening procedures are employing liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques with information-dependent acquisition (IDA) approaches more and more often. It is known that the complexity of a sample and the IDA settings might prevent important compounds from being triggered. Therefore, data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods should be more suitable for systematic toxicological analysis (STA). The DIA method sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH), which uses Q1 windows of 20−35 Da for data-independent fragmentation, was systematically investigated for its suitability for STA. Quality of SWATH- generated mass spectra were evaluated with regard to mass error, relative abundance of the fragments, and library hits. With the Q1 window set to 20−25 Da, several precursors pass Q1 at the same time and are fragmented, thus impairing the library search algorithms to a different extent: forward fit was less affected than reverse fit and purity fit. Mass error was not affected. The relative abundance of the fragments was concentration dependent for some analytes and was influenced by cofragmentation, especially of deuterated analogues. Also, the detection rate of IDA compared to SWATH was investigated in a forced coelution experiment (up to 20 analytes coeluting). Even using several different IDA settings, it was observed that IDA failed to trigger relevant compounds. Screening results of 382 authentic forensic cases revealed that SWATH's detection rate was superior to IDA, which failed to trigger ∼10{\%} of the analytes.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

abstract = {Pseudotargeted metabolic profiling is a novel strategy combining the advantages of both targeted and untargeted methods. The strategy obtains metabolites and their product ions from quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS by information-dependent acquisition (IDA) and then picks targeted ion pairs and measures them on a triple-quadrupole MS by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The picking of ion pairs from thousands of candidates is the most time-consuming step of the pseudotargeted strategy. Herein, a systematic and automated approach and software (MRM-Ion Pair Finder) were developed to acquire characteristic MRM ion pairs by precursor ions alignment, MS(2) spectrum extraction and reduction, characteristic product ion selection, and ion fusion. To test the reliability of the approach, a mixture of 15 metabolite standards was first analyzed; the representative ion pairs were correctly picked out. Then, pooled serum samples were further studied, and the results were confirmed by the manual selection. Finally, a comparison with a commercial peak alignment software was performed, and a good characteristic ion coverage of metabolites was obtained. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach was applied to a metabolomics study of liver cancer; 854 metabolite ion pairs were defined in the positive ion mode from serum. Our approach provides a high throughput method which is reliable to acquire MRM ion pairs for pseudotargeted metabolomics with improved metabolite coverage and facilitate more reliable biomarkers discoveries.},

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is a relatively new field of 'omics' technology that is primarily concerned with the global or system-wide characterization of small molecule metabolites using technologies such as nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. Its unique focus on small molecules and the physiological effects of small molecules aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and technical overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research, metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline, from lead compound discovery to post-approval drug surveillance. This review explores some of the most interesting or significant applications of metabolomics as they relate to pharmaceutical research and development. Specific examples are given that show how metabolomics can be used to facilitate lead compound discovery, to improve biomarker identification (for monitoring disease status and drug efficacy) and to monitor drug metabolism and toxicity. Other applications are also discussed, including the use of metabolomics to facilitate clinical trial testing and to improve post-approval drug monitoring. These examples show that metabolomics potentially offer drug researchers and drug regulators an effective, inexpensive route to addressing many of the riskier or more expensive issues associated with the discovery, development and monitoring of drug products.},

abstract = {In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed many loci showing non-canonical, large open chromatin domains over the entire transcribed units in minor ZGA, supporting the presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together, these data reveal a unique spatiotemporal chromatin configuration that accompanies early mammalian development.},
