abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of MS level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant MS/MS (idMS/MS) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both MS and idMS/MS data, and feature-feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the MS and idMS/MS data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source MS and/or idMS/MS spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called RAMClustR, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.},

abstract = {Natural products (NPs) research is changing and rapidly adopting cutting-edge tools, which radically transform the way to characterize extracts and small molecules. With the innovations in metabolomics, early integration of deep metabolome annotation information allows to efficiently guide the isolation of valuable NPs only and, in parallel, to generate massive metadata sets for the study of given extracts under various perspectives. This is the case for chemotaxonomy studies where common biosynthetic traits among species can be evidenced, but also for drug discovery purpose where such traits, in combination with bioactivity studies on extracts, may evidence bioactive molecules even before their isolation. One of the major bottlenecks of such studies remains the level of accuracy at which NPs can be identified. We discuss here the advancements in LC–MS and associated mining methods by addressing what would be ideal and what is achieved today. We propose future developments for reinforcing generic NPs databases both in the spectral and structural dimensions by heading towards a virtuous metabolite identification cycle allowing annotation of both known and unreported metabolites in an iterative manner. Such approaches could significantly accelerate and improve our knowledge of the huge chemodiversity found in nature.},

Typical metabolomic experiments can therefore produce large amounts of data. Handling such complex datasets is an important step that has big impact on extent and quality at which the metabolite identification and quantification can be made, and thus on the ultimate biological interpretation of results. Increasing interest in metabolomics thus led to resurgence of interest in related data processing. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The field of metabolomics has expanded greatly over the past two decades, both as an experimental science with applications in many areas, as well as in regards to data standards and bioinformatics software tools. The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software tools. OBJECTIVES To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and tools that are used primarily in metabolomics. METHODS The most widely used tools were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the tool being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Tools were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. LC-MS, GC-MS or NMR) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. RESULTS A comprehensive list of the most used tools was compiled. Each tool is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable tools of the same domain. An extended list including additional tools is available at https://github.com/RASpicer/MetabolomicsTools which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. CONCLUSION This review presents the most widely used tools for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality. As future work, we suggest a direct comparison of tools' abilities to perform specific data analysis tasks e.g. peak picking.},

abstract = {Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.},

abstract = {Pseudotargeted metabolic profiling is a novel strategy combining the advantages of both targeted and untargeted methods. The strategy obtains metabolites and their product ions from quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS by information-dependent acquisition (IDA) and then picks targeted ion pairs and measures them on a triple-quadrupole MS by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The picking of ion pairs from thousands of candidates is the most time-consuming step of the pseudotargeted strategy. Herein, a systematic and automated approach and software (MRM-Ion Pair Finder) were developed to acquire characteristic MRM ion pairs by precursor ions alignment, MS(2) spectrum extraction and reduction, characteristic product ion selection, and ion fusion. To test the reliability of the approach, a mixture of 15 metabolite standards was first analyzed; the representative ion pairs were correctly picked out. Then, pooled serum samples were further studied, and the results were confirmed by the manual selection. Finally, a comparison with a commercial peak alignment software was performed, and a good characteristic ion coverage of metabolites was obtained. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach was applied to a metabolomics study of liver cancer; 854 metabolite ion pairs were defined in the positive ion mode from serum. Our approach provides a high throughput method which is reliable to acquire MRM ion pairs for pseudotargeted metabolomics with improved metabolite coverage and facilitate more reliable biomarkers discoveries.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS2 data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS2 data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS2 data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS2 fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS2 spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS2 scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS2 fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS2 analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS2 spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS2 data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The consumption of high amounts of fructose is associated with metabolic diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Objective: To determine the effects of high fructose intake on plasma metabolomics. Study design: We enrolled 12 healthy volunteers (six lean and six obese women, age 24–35 years) in a crossover intervention study. All participants carried out three diets: (1) low fructose ({\textless}10 g/day); (2) high fructose (100 g/day) from natural food sources (fruit); and (3) high fructose (100 g/day) from high fructose syrup (HFS). Outcome measures: The primary outcome was changes in plasma metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics. Results: High compared to low fructose diets caused a marked metabolite class separation, especially because of changes in acylcarnitine and lysophosphatidylcholine levels. Both high fructose diets resulted in a decrease in mean acylcarnitine levels in all subjects, and an increase in mean lysophosphatidylcholine and diacyl-phosphatidylcholine levels in obese individuals. Medium chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with serum levels of liver enzymes and with the fatty liver index. Discussion: The metabolic shifts induced by high fructose consumption suggest an inhibition of mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation and an increase in lipid peroxidation. The effects tended to be more pronounced following the HFS than the fruit diet.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This method provided good chromatographic resolution and peak shape for all eight compounds within a 19 min run time. The baseline was clean, the lower limit of quantification was below 0.3 ??mol/L for all adenine nucleotides and the method demonstrated good linearity. Within-day precision ranged from 0.7 to 5.9{\%} and between-days from 2.6 to 15.3{\%}.

However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84{\%} of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames.

abstract = {? 2014, The Author(s).Phenotyping of 1,200 ?healthy? adults from the UK has been performed through the investigation of diverse classes of hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites present in serum by applying a series of chromatography?mass spectrometry platforms. These data were made robust to instrumental drift by numerical correction; this was prerequisite to allow detection of subtle metabolic differences. The variation in observed metabolite relative concentrations between the 1,200 subjects ranged from less than 5?{\%} to more than 200?{\%}. Variations in metabolites could be related to differences in gender, age, BMI, blood pressure, and smoking. Investigations suggest that a sample size of 600 subjects is both necessary and sufficient for robust analysis of these data. Overall, this is a large scale and non-targeted chromatographic MS-based metabolomics study, using samples from over 1,000 individuals, to provide a comprehensive measurement of their serum metabolomes. This work provides an important baseline or reference dataset for understanding the ?normal? relative concentrations and variation in the human serum metabolome. These may be related to our increasing knowledge of the human metabolic network map. Information on the Husermet study is available at http://www.husermet.org/. Importantly, all of the data are made freely available at MetaboLights (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/).},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The use of liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has enabled the high-throughput profiling of the metabolite composition of biological samples. However, the large amount of data obtained can be difficult to analyse and often requires computational processing to understand which metabolites are present in a sample. This article looks at the dual problem of annotating peaks in a sample with a metabolite, together with putatively annotating whether a metabolite is present in the sample. The starting point of the approach is a Bayesian clustering of peaks into groups, each corresponding to putative adducts and isotopes of a single metabolite.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Bayesian modelling introduced here combines information from the mass-to-charge ratio, retention time and intensity of each peak, together with a model of the inter-peak dependency structure, to increase the accuracy of peak annotation. The results inherently contain a quantitative estimate of confidence in the peak annotations and allow an accurate trade-off between precision and recall. Extensive validation experiments using authentic chemical standards show that this system is able to produce more accurate putative identifications than other state-of-the-art systems, while at the same time giving a probabilistic measure of confidence in the annotations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software has been implemented as part of the mzMatch metabolomics analysis pipeline, which is available for download at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry proteomics typically relies upon analyzing outcomes of single analyses; however, comparing raw data across multiple experiments should enhance both peptide/protein identification and quantitation. In the absence of convincing tandem MS identifications, comparing peptide quantities between experiments (or fractions) requires the chromatographic alignment of MS signals. An extension of dynamic time warping (DTW), termed ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp), is presented and used to align a variety of electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS) proteomics data sets. An algorithm to produce a bijective (one-to-one) function from DTW output is coupled with piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to produce a smooth warping function. Data sets were chosen to represent a broad selection of ESI-LC-MS alignment cases. High confidence, overlapping tandem mass spectra are used as standards to optimize and compare alignment parameters. We determine that Pearson's correlation coefficient as a measure of spectra similarity outperforms covariance, dot product, and Euclidean distance in its ability to produce correct alignments with optimal and suboptimal alignment parameters. We demonstrate the importance of penalizing gaps for best alignments. Using optimized parameters, we show that OBI-Warp produces alignments consistent with time standards across these data sets. The source and executables are released under MIT style license at http://obi-warp.sourceforge.net/.},

Initially, the platform was developed for two-group comparisons to match the independent, "control" versus "disease" experimental design. Here, we introduce an enhanced XCMS Online interface that enables users to perform dependent (paired) two-group comparisons, meta-analysis, and multigroup comparisons, with comprehensive statistical output and interactive visualization tools. Newly incorporated statistical tests cover a wide array of trnivariate analyses. Multigroup comparison allows for the identification of differentially expressed metabolite features across multiple classes of data while higher order meta-analysis facilitates the identification of shared metabolic patterns across multiple two-group comparisons. Given the complexity of these data sets, we have developed an interactive platform where users can monitor the statistical output of univariate (cloud plots) and multivariate (PCA plots) data analysis in real time by adjusting the threshold and range of various parameters. On the interactive cloud plot, metabolite features can be filtered out by their significance level (p-value), fold change, mass-to-charge ratio, retention time, and intensity. The variation pattern of each feature can be visualized on both extracted-ion chromatograms and box plots. The interactive principal component analysis includes scores, loadings, and scree plots that can be adjusted depending on scaling criteria. The utility of XCMS fiinctionalities is demonstrated through the metabolomic analysis of bacterial stress response and the comparison of lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines.},

We implemented a quantitative polar metabolomics profiling platform using selected reaction monitoring with a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer that covers all major metabolic pathways. The platform uses hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with positive/negative ion switching to analyze 258 metabolites (289 Q1/Q3 transitions) from a single 15-min liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition with a 3-ms dwell time and a 1.55-s duty cycle time. Previous platforms use more than one experiment to profile this number of metabolites from different ionization modes. The platform is compatible with polar metabolites from any biological source, including fresh tissues, cancer cells, bodily fluids and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Relative quantification can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total ion current can be used for statistical analyses and pathway analyses across biological sample conditions. The procedure takes approximately 12 h from metabolite extraction to peak integration for a data set containing 15 total samples ( approximately 6 h for a single sample).},

abstract = {Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing biological questions. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is widely used for metabolic characterization, including targeted and untargeted approaches. Despite recent innovations, a crucial aspect of this technique is the sample preparation for accurate data analyses. In this protocol, we present a robust and adaptable workflow for metabolic analyses of mammalian cells from adherent cell cultures, which is particularly suited for qualitative and quantitative central metabolite characterization by LC-MS. Each sample consists of 6,000,000 mammalian cells grown on cover glasses, allowing for fast and complete transfer of the cells for metabolite extraction or medium exchange, e.g., for labeling experiments. The sampling procedure includes a fast and efficient washing step in liquid flow in water, which reduces cross-contamination and matrix effects while minimizing perturbation of the metabolic steady state of the cells; it is followed by quenching cell metabolism. The latter is achieved by using a -20 °C cold methanol acetonitrile mixture acidified with formic acid, followed by freeze drying, metabolite extraction and LC-MS. The protocol requires 2 s for cell sampling until quenching, and the entire protocol takes a total of 1.5 h per sample when the provided nanoscale LC-MS method is applied.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Batch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. OBJECTIVES This paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects. METHODS Batch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC-MS and GC-MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS The three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects-replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered. CONCLUSION The use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biologic samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biologic studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biologic samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biologic study.},

Following an exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured abundance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.},

RosettaAntibody produced accurate, physically realistic models, with all framework regions and 42 of the 55 non-H3 CDR loops predicted to under an {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m. The performance is notable when modeling H3 on a homology framework, where RosettaAntibody produced the best model among all participants for four of the 11 targets, two of which were predicted with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m accuracy. To improve RosettaAntibody, we pursued the causes of model errors. The most common limitation was template unavailability, underscoring the need for more antibody structures and/or better de novo loop methods. In some cases, better templates could have been found by considering residues outside of the CDRs. De novo CDR H3 modeling remains challenging at long loop lengths, but constraining the C-terminal end of H3 to a kinked conformation allows near-native conformations to be sampled more frequently. We also found that incorrect VL -VH orientations caused models with low H3 RMSDs to score poorly, suggesting that correct VL -VH orientations will improve discrimination between near-native and incorrect conformations. These observations will guide the future development of RosettaAntibody. Proteins 2014; 82:1611-1623. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Urine has long been a "favored" biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes, largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another 2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies.

abstract = {Forensic and clinical toxicological screening procedures are employing liquid chromatography−tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques with information-dependent acquisition (IDA) approaches more and more often. It is known that the complexity of a sample and the IDA settings might prevent important compounds from being triggered. Therefore, data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods should be more suitable for systematic toxicological analysis (STA). The DIA method sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH), which uses Q1 windows of 20−35 Da for data-independent fragmentation, was systematically investigated for its suitability for STA. Quality of SWATH- generated mass spectra were evaluated with regard to mass error, relative abundance of the fragments, and library hits. With the Q1 window set to 20−25 Da, several precursors pass Q1 at the same time and are fragmented, thus impairing the library search algorithms to a different extent: forward fit was less affected than reverse fit and purity fit. Mass error was not affected. The relative abundance of the fragments was concentration dependent for some analytes and was influenced by cofragmentation, especially of deuterated analogues. Also, the detection rate of IDA compared to SWATH was investigated in a forced coelution experiment (up to 20 analytes coeluting). Even using several different IDA settings, it was observed that IDA failed to trigger relevant compounds. Screening results of 382 authentic forensic cases revealed that SWATH's detection rate was superior to IDA, which failed to trigger ∼10{\%} of the analytes.},

Although metabolites are frequently modified, these modifications have not been studied using -omics approaches. Here a general strategy for the nontargeted profiling of modified metabolites, which we call "nontargeted modification-specific metabolomics", is reported. A key aspect of this strategy was the combination of in-source collision-induced dissociation liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and global nontargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics. Characteristic neutral loss fragments that are specific for acetylation, sulfation, glucuronidation, glucosidation, or ribose conjugation were reproducibly detected using human urine as a model specimen for method development. The practical application of this method was demonstrated by profiling urine samples from liver cirrhosis patients. Approximately 900 features were identified as modified endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics. Moreover, this strategy supports the identification of compounds not included in traditional metabolomics databases (HMDB, Metlin, and KEGG), which are currently referred to as "unknowns" in metabolomics projects.

abstract = {The annotation of small molecules remains a major challenge in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. We here critically discuss structured elucidation approaches and software that are designed to help during the annotation of unknown compounds. Only by elucidating unknown metabolites first is it possible to biologically interpret complex systems, to map compounds to pathways and to create reliable predictive metabolic models for translational and clinical research. These strategies include the construction and quality of tandem mass spectral databases such as the coalition of MassBank repositories and investigations of MS/MS matching confidence. We present in silico fragmentation tools such as MS-FINDER, CFM-ID, MetFrag, ChemDistiller and CSI:FingerID that can annotate compounds from existing structure databases and that have been used in the CASMI (critical assessment of small molecule identification) contests. Furthermore, the use of retention time models from liquid chromatography and the utility of collision cross-section modelling from ion mobility experiments are covered. Workflows and published examples of successfully annotated unknown compounds are included.},

abstract = {Untargeted analysis performed using full-scan mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used in metabolomics. Although they are commonly employed, full-scan MS methods such as quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS have been restricted by various factors including their limited linear range and complicated data processing. LC coupled with triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is the gold standard for metabolite quantification; however, only known metabolites are generally quantified, limiting its applications in metabolomic analysis. In this study, a pseudotargeted approach was proposed to perform serum metabolomic analysis using an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/QQQ MS system operated in the MRM mode, for which the MRM ion pairs were acquired from the serum samples through untargeted tandem MS using UHPLC/Q-TOF MS. The UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted method displayed better repeatability and wider linear range than the traditional UHPLC/Q-TOF MS-based untargeted metabolomics method, and no complicated peak alignment was required. The developed method was applied to discover serum biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC had decreased lysophosphatidylcholine, increased long-chain and decreased medium-chain acylcarnitines, and increased aromatic and decreased branched-chain amino acid levels compared to healthy controls. The novelty of this work is that it provides an approach to acquire MRM ion pairs from real samples, is not limited to metabolite standards, and it provides a foundation to achieve pseudotargeted metabolomic analysis on the widely used LC/QQQ MS platform.},

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB's chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC-MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.},

@article{Olivon2017,
abstract = {Molecular networking is becoming more and more popular into the metabolomic community to organize tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data. Even though this approach allows the treatment and comparison of large data sets, several drawbacks related to the MS-Cluster tool routinely used on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) limit its potential. MS-Cluster cannot distinguish between chromatography well-resolved isomers as retention times are not taken into account. Annotation with predicted chemical formulas is also not implemented and semiquantification is only based on the number of MS 2 scans. We propose to introduce a data-preprocessing workflow including the preliminary data treatment by MZmine 2 followed by a homemade Python script freely available to the community that clears the major previously mentioned GNPS drawbacks. The efficiency of this workflow is exemplified with the analysis of six fractions of increasing polarities obtained from a sequential supercritical CO 2 extraction of Stillingia lineata leaves. A mong the several mass spectrometry based metabolomics workflows recently developed, 1,2 Molecular Networking (MN) has appeared as a promising approach to dereplicate complex natural product mixtures. 3 This tool is becoming a standard for metabolomics analysis and gathers together a community of nearly 10000 users from 100 countries. MN significantly facilitates the tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2) data classification by organizing spectra sharing homologous fragmentations into a user-friendly visual representation. Assuming that similar molecules share similar fragmentation patterns, structurally related compounds are prone to cluster together within a network. Unlike many other dereplication strategies, MN has the unique advantage to identify known compounds through the integration of authentic standards or comparison with spectral libraries, but also to target unknown analogues more efficiently. Thus, standard MS 2 data act as "structural landmarks", enabling the annotation of related clusters of spectra. Despite valuable outputs, some improvements are still required to generate unambiguous molecular networks. Initially developed for proteomics purposes, the MS-Cluster algorithm implemented on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) platform was developed for the identification of redundant spectra from a same peptide and their replacement with a single averaged spectrum. 4 Based on the premise that occurrence of truly isobaric peptides eluting at different retention times (RTs) in liquid chromatography (LC) is rather uncommon in proteomics, MS-Cluster developers did not integrate RT information for restricted clustering over limited RT ranges. However, in metabolomics samples, the separation of isomers is common. By activating the MS-Cluster option, groups of isomers will ineluctably gather together within the same nodes leading to merge MS 2 data unexpectedly. Furthermore, GNPS quantification system simply relies on the number of MS 2 spectra detected for each precursor ion. This method is highly dependent on the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode parameters (number of precursor ions per scan, ion intensity threshold, exclusion rules). Thus, GNPS quantification only leads to a rough approximation of relative or absolute abundances. Finally, annotation of molecular networks by molecular formula generated from any commercial or freely available algorithm is not currently implemented. In the meantime, to face the increasing amount of data generated by untargeted LC-MS analyses of complex mixtures, numerous free software suites, such as XCMS, 5 MetaboAna-lyst, 6 OpenMS, 7 MaxQuant, 8 or SMART, 9 have been developed. These programs include sophisticated computational pipelines that typically consist of peak picking, integration, linear or nonlinear alignment, and normalization steps in order to extract meaningful information. Among them, MZmine 2 is one of the most popular and user-friendly software packages for metabolomics. 10 Its motivation is to propose straightforward operations for nonexpert users and a flexible and modular platform for MS data processing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Untargeted metabolomics generates a huge amount of data. Software packages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these data. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing.RESULTS:We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments.IPO optimizes XCMS peak picking parameters by using natural, stable 13C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak groups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups that show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models. IPO was tested on three different data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. IPO resulted in an increase of reliable groups (146{\%} - 361{\%}), a decrease of non-reliable groups (3{\%} - 8{\%}) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third.CONCLUSIONS:IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We were also able to show the potential of IPO to increase the reliability of metabolomics data.The source code is implemented in R, tested on Linux and Windows and it is freely available for download at https://github.com/glibiseller/IPO webcite. The training sets and test sets can be downloaded from https://health.joanneum.at/IPO webcite.},

Scoring of hits is based on a “shared peak count” method that identifies masses of fragment ions shared between the analytical and reference MS/MS spectra. Another functional component ofXCMS2 is the capability of providing structural information for unknown metabolites, which are not in the METLIN database.

abstract = {Global profiling of metabolites in biological samples by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry results in datasets too large to evaluate manually. Fortunately, a variety of software programs are now available to automate the data analysis. Selection of the appropriate processing solution is dependent upon experimental design. Most metabolomic studies a decade ago had a relatively simple experimental design in which the intensities of compounds were compared between only two sample groups. More recently, however, increasingly sophisticated applications have been pursued. Examples include comparing compound intensities between multiple sample groups and unbiasedly tracking the fate of specific isotopic labels. The latter types of applications have necessitated the development of new software programs, which have introduced additional functionalities that facilitate data analysis. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the freely available bioinformatic solutions that are either based upon or are compatible with the algorithms in XCMS, which we broadly refer to here as the 'XCMS family' of software. These include CAMERA, credentialing, Warpgroup, metaXCMS, X13CMS, and XCMS Online. Together, these informatic technologies can accommodate most cutting-edge metabolomic applications and offer unique advantages when compared to the original XCMS program.},

abstract = {Background: Various alterations in lipid metabolism have been observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives: To determine the levels of lipid species in plasma from CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients and test their association with CKD severity and patient outcome. Methods: Seventy-seven patients with CKD stage 2 to HD were grouped into classes of CKD severity at baseline and followed-up for 3.5 years for the occurrence of transition to HD or death (combined outcome). Plasma levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and fatty acids were analyzed by flow-injection analysis coupled to tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Kruskal Wallis rank tests and Cox regressions were used to analyze the association of lipids with CKD severity and the risk of combined outcome, respectively. Results: The plasma level of PCs, LPCs, and SMs was decreased in HD patients compared with nondialyzed CKD patients (all P {\textless}.05), whereas esterified and/or nonesterified fatty acids level did not change. Thirty-four lipids displayed significantly lower abundance in plasma of HD patients, whereas elaidic acid (C18:1$\omega$9t) level was increased (P {\textless}.001). The total amount of LPCs and individual LPCs were associated with better outcome (P {\textless}.05). In particular, LPC 18:2 and LPC 20:3 were statistically associated with outcome in adjusted models (P {\textless}.05). Discussion: In HD patients, a reduction in plasma lipids is observed. Some of the alterations, namely reduced LPCs, were associated with the risk of adverse outcome. These changes could be related to metabolic dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Thousands of articles using metabolomics approaches are published every year. With the increasing amounts of data being produced, mere description of investigations as text in manuscripts is not sufficient to enable re-use anymore: the underlying data needs to be published together with the findings in the literature to maximise the benefit from public and private expenditure and to take advantage of an enormous opportunity to improve scientific reproducibility in metabolomics and cognate disciplines. Reporting recommendations in metabolomics started to emerge about a decade ago and were mostly concerned with inventories of the information that had to be reported in the literature for consistency. In recent years, metabolomics data standards have developed extensively, to include the primary research data, derived results and the experimental description and importantly the metadata in a machine-readable way. This includes vendor independent data standards such as mzML for mass spectrometry and nmrML for NMR raw data that have both enabled the development of advanced data processing algorithms by the scientific community. Standards such as ISA-Tab cover essential metadata, including the experimental design, the applied protocols, association between samples, data files and the experimental factors for further statistical analysis. Altogether, they pave the way for both reproducible research and data reuse, including meta-analyses. Further incentives to prepare standards compliant data sets include new opportunities to publish data sets, but also require a little "arm twisting" in the author guidelines of scientific journals to submit the data sets to public repositories such as the NIH Metabolomics Workbench or MetaboLights at EMBL-EBI. In the present article, we look at standards for data sharing, investigate their impact in metabolomics and give suggestions to improve their adoption.},

abstract = {Enzymes regulate biological processes through the conversion of specific substrates to products. Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that FAAH exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific FAAH substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.},

However, the suc- cessful translation of biomarkers into clinical or biologically relevant indicators is limited. Results: With the aim of improving the discovery of translatable metabolite biomarkers, we present search analytics for over one million METLIN metabolite database queries. The most common me- tabolites found in METLIN were cross-correlated against XCMS Online, the widely used cloud- based data processing and pathway analysis platform.

LC-MS measurements are, however, significantly complicated by several tech. challenges, including: (1) ionization suppression/enhancement, disturbing the correct quantification of analytes, and (2) the detection of large amts. of sep. deriv. ions, increasing the complexity of the spectra, but not their information content. Here we introduce an exptl. and anal. strategy that leads to robust metabolome profiles in the face of these challenges. Our method is based on rigorous filtering of the measured signals based on a series of sample dilns. Such data sets have the addnl. characteristic that they allow a more robust assessment of detection signal quality for each metabolite. Using our method, almost 80{\%} of the recorded signals can be discarded as uninformative, while important information is retained. As a consequence, we obtain a broader understanding of the information content of our analyses and a better assessment of the metabolites detected in the analyzed data sets. We illustrate the applicability of this method using std. mixts., as well as cell exts. from bacterial samples. It is evident that this method can be applied in many types of LC-MS analyses and more specifically in untargeted metabolomics. [on SciFinder(R)]},

There has been a recent development to replace spectral libraries by molecular structure databases when searching the MS/MS data of the unknown compound. Several tools have been developed for this task, including CFM-ID, MetFrag, MAGMa(+), FingerID and CSI:FingerID. These methods are already helpful for everyday metabolomics; with further advances, these methods can become indispensable tools for tomorrow's metabolomics. Here, I discuss several questions related to this task, such as: Why not wait for spectral libraries to grow sufficiently? Why evaluate methods outside their ‘comfort zone'? Should we use prior information such as citation frequencies? And, ultimately: are we there yet?},

Its unique focus on small molecules and the physiological effects of small molecules aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and technical overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research, metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline, from lead compound discovery to post-approval drug surveillance. This review explores some of the most interesting or significant applications of metabolomics as they relate to pharmaceutical research and development. Specific examples are given that show how metabolomics can be used to facilitate lead compound discovery, to improve biomarker identification (for monitoring disease status and drug efficacy) and to monitor drug metabolism and toxicity. Other applications are also discussed, including the use of metabolomics to facilitate clinical trial testing and to improve post-approval drug monitoring. These examples show that metabolomics potentially offer drug researchers and drug regulators an effective, inexpensive route to addressing many of the riskier or more expensive issues associated with the discovery, development and monitoring of drug products.},

In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

These include heterodimers and higher complex adducts, distal fragments, relationships between peaks in different polarities, and complex adducts between features and background peaks.

abstract = {Metabolomics experiments are inevitably sub-ject to a component of unwanted variation, due to factors such as batch effects, long runs of samples, and confounding biological variation. Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognized need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment. Software for the approach is made freely available.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is routinely used for metabolomics experiments. In contrast to the fairly routine and automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form a major bottleneck in data interpretation. Here we present CAMERA, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7{\%} and 90.3{\%} of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We demonstrate the utility of CAMERA in two different, easily adoptable plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of CAMERA drastically reduced the amount of manual analysis.},

abstract = {Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear. Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1$\beta$, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N(4)-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1$\beta$, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is an important analytical technology for e.g. metabolomics experiments. Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features - a reliable feature detection is mandatory.RESULTS:We developed a new feature detection algorithm "centWave" for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity. CONCLUSIONS:The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine. The centWave algorithm was integrated into the Bioconductor R-package XCMS and is available from http://www.bioconductor.org/.},

The chemistry of molecules dictates how they will be fragmented by MS/MS in the gas phase and, therefore, two related molecules are likely to display similar fragment ion spectra. Molecular networking organizes the MS/MS data as a relational spectral network thereby mapping the chemistry that was detected in an MS/MS-based metabolomics experiment. Although the wider utility of molecular networking is just beginning to be recognized, in this review we highlight the principles behind molecular networking and its use for the discovery of therapeutic leads, monitoring drug metabolism, clinical diagnostics, and emerging applications in precision medicine.},

abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics provides a comprehensive platform to identify metabolites whose levels are altered between two or more populations. By using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of- flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS), hundreds to thousands of peaks with a unique retention time are routinely detected from most biological samples in an untargeted profiling m/z and experiment. Each peak, termed a metabolomic feature, can be characterized on the basis of its accurate mass, retention time, and tandem mass spectral fragmentation pattern. Here a 7-step protocol is suggested for such a characterization by using the METLIN metabolite database. The protocol starts from untargeted metabolomic LC-Q-ToF-MS data that has been analyzed with the bioinformatic program XCMS, and describes a strategy for selecting interesting features as well as performing subsequent targeted tandem mass spectrometry. The 7 steps described will require 2-4 hours to complete per feature, depending on the compound. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Biological systems are increasingly being studied in a holistic manner, using omics approaches, to provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the diverse collection of cellular components. Among the omics approaches, metabolomics, which deals with the quantitative global profiling of small molecules or metabolites, is being used extensively to explore the dynamic response of living systems, such as organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms, under diverse physiological and pathological conditions. This technology is now used routinely in a number of applications, including basic and clinical research, agriculture, microbiology, food science, nutrition, pharmaceutical research, environmental science and the development of biofuels. Of the multiple analytical platforms available to perform such analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry have come to dominate, owing to the high resolution and large datasets that can be generated with these techniques. The large multidimensional datasets that result from such studies must be processed and analyzed to render this data meaningful. Thus, bioinformatics tools are essential for the efficient processing of huge datasets, the characterization of the detected signals, and to align multiple datasets and their features. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of the data processing tools available, and reviews a collection of recent reports on the topic. Data conversion, pre-processing, alignment, normalization and statistical analysis are introduced, with their advantages and disadvantages, and comparisons are made to guide the reader.},

abstract = {Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) provide a simple model for studying essential hypertension. Their genetic and metabolic features are of great interest because they may provide insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying essential hypertension. We have thus investigated the metabolic characteristics of SHR at various ages, covering the prehypertensive stage and the developmental phase of hypertension, using a (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomic approach. Twenty-four-hour urine samples from the SHR and their age-matched normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rats, were analyzed using (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and the spectral data were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) to find metabolic differences between the two strains. Consequently, it was possible to separate the urine samples between the two strains at any age ranging from 4 to 20 weeks in the principal component scores plots. The major spectral regions and signals (metabolites) contributing to the separation were picked up based on the loadings. Subsequently, the urinary excreted levels of metabolites highlighted by the PCA were compared based on the signal intensities corrected by urine volume and body weight. These investigations revealed the major metabolic changes characteristic of the SHR, which included differences in citrate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinate, hippurate, phenylacetylglycine, p-cresol glucuronide, creatine, taurine, medium-chain dicarboxylates (tentative), unknown ($\delta$ 3.11), and the regions at 3.60, 3.64, 3.68 and 3.88 p.p.m. The results supported the occurrence of metabolic acidosis in the SHR in the period of prehypertension as well as rapidly rising blood pressure. In addition, the intestinal microfloral populations in the SHR were suggested to be altered in the developmental phase of hypertension.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 17 November 2011; doi:10.1038/hr.2011.182.},
