```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

- POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood; it use a useful class when you want to store times in something like a data frame.  

- POSIXlt is a list underneath and it stores a bunch of other useful information like the day of the week, day of the year, month, day of the month.  


There are a number of generic fnctions that work on dates and times  

- `weekdays`: gives the day of the week  
- `months`: give the month name  
- `quarters`: give the quater number ("Q1", "Q2", "Q3" or "Q4")  


```{r}
x <- Sys.time()
x
```

```{r}
p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
names(unclass(p))
p$sec
p$min
p$hour
p$mday
p$mon
p$year
p$wday
p$yday
p$isdst
p$zone
p$gmtoff
```

```{r}
unclass(x) # seconds since 1900
```
