```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

`sort` sorts the vector in an ascending order  

`rank` gives the respective rank of the numbers present in the vector, the smallest number receiving the rank 1.  

`order` returns the indices of the vector in a sorted order.  

```{r}
x <- c(3, 1, 2, 5, 4)
sort(x) # will give c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

rank(x) # will give c(3, 1, 2, 5, 4)

order(x) # will give c(2, 3, 1, 5, 4).
# if you put these indices in this order, you will get the sorted vector. 
# x[2] = 1, x[3] = 2, x[1] = 3, x[5] = 5, x[4] = 5
