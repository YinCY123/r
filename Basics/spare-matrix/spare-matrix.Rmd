```

```
this tutorial is to convert single cell data matrix to sparse matrix so that is can be easily load to Seurat R package for down stream data analysis
```


```{r generate-similation-data}
mat <- matrix(data = sample(x = c(0,1), size = 100, replace = T, prob = c(0.3, 0.7)), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
rownames(mat) <- paste("gene_", 1:10, sep = "")
colnames(mat) <- paste("cell_", 1:10, sep = "")
```

```{r convert-matrix-to-sparse-matrix}
mat_spare <- Matrix(data = mat, sparse = TRUE)
```

```{r save-the-file}
writeMM(obj = mat_spare, file = "matrix.mtx")
write(x = rownames(mat), file = "genes.tsv")
write(x = colnames(mat), file = "barcodes.tsv")
```
