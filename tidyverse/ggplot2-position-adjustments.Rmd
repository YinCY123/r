Three adjustments apply primarily to bars  

- `position_stack()`: stack overlapping bars (or areas) on top of each other.  
- `position_fill()`: stack overlapping bars, scaling so the top is always at 1.  
- `position_dodge()`: place overlapping bars (or boxplots) side-by-side.  


Three position adjustments that are primarily useful for points  

- `position_undge()`: move points by a fixed offset.  
- `position_jitter()`: add a little random noise to every position.  
- `position_jitterdodge()`: dodge points within groups, then add a little random noise.
