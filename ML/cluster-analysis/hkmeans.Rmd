# Algorithm
1. Compute hierarchical clustering and cut the tree into k-clusters  
2. Compute the center (i.e the mean) of each cluster  
3. Compute k-means by using the set of cluster centers (defined in step 2) as the initial cluster centers.  

# example
```{r}
library(factoextra)

df <- scale(USArrests)
res.hk <- hkmeans(df, 4)

fviz_dend(res.hk, 
          cex = 0.6, 
          palette = "jco", 
          rect = T, 
          rect_border = "jco", 
          rect_fill = TRUE)
```

```{r}
fviz_cluster(res.hk, 
             palette = "jco", 
             repel = T, 
             ggtheme = theme_classic())
```
