### Abstract    
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease, which charcaterized with the death of photoreceptors and degeneration of retina pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris (CC). In the early stage of AMD CC dropout has been identified. This implies that CC changes ahead of most noticable sign of early stage AMD, such as drusen deposition, reduced blood flow. But the mechinism of how CC changes may affact retina degeneration is largely unknown. Exploring the role of CC in AMD progression will provide better understanding of AMD pathogenesis, while providing more valuable prevention and therapeutic targets. Here we find that TGFB1 expressed by CC endothelial cells might contribute to the progression of AMD.

### Introduction    
To date, most of the research about the pathgenesis of AMD are focused on the retine pigment epithelium (RPE). Recent Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and Histopathological studies have found that changes have taken place in the CC in the early stage of AMD, such as reduced blood flow and CC dropout, and the progression is positively correlated with the severity of AMD [@Sohn2019;@Chatziralli2018;@Chirco2017;@Seddon2016;@Parviz2017]. This imply that before noticable sign of early AMD and that CC might be the earliest changed tissue associated with AMD progression.  

In the late stage, AMD can be divided into two classes, Geographic Atrophy (dry AMD) and neovascular AMD (wet AMD). Many risk factors have been identified associated with AMD, such as cigarette smoking, racial, Cardiovascular disease[@Wong2014a;@Fine1983;@Evans2001] and the most significant unmodifiable factor aging. Whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified numerous significant sites associated with AMD[@Fritsche2013], but many of their's roles in AMD pathgenesis is still not well understand.  

The well known function of CC is supplying oxygen and nutrients to the out retina and retina pigment epithelium (RPE) while removing waste[@Chirco2017;@Nickla2010]. These functions are critical in light of the substantial metabolic activity of the neural retina. In the light of above findings, here we trying to understand how CC might affact RPE in the progress of AMD, and we find that TGFB1 expressed by CC might affact the expression of AMD related gene COL10A1 in RPE and this might contribute to the progression of AMD.  


### Methods  
To explore how CC endothelial cells maight regulate age-related gene expression in retina pigment epithelial, first, we using the single cell RNA-seq data of neovascular AMD enriched by CD31 from chorid[@Voigt2019a]. 

Cells are influenced by extracellular signals produced by cells in their microenvironment. CC as an oxygen and nutrients supplier to RPE and out retina, communications bettween these cells should be exists, here we explory how CC endothelial changes in the choroid might contribute to the onset of RPE degeneration. Based on prior knowlege on signaling and gene regulatory networks, we use network propagation methods on the integrated networks to infer active ligands expressed by CC endothelial cells and their gene regulatory effects on RPE using nichenetr[@Browaeys2019], an R package, and Next Generation Sequencing data deposited on Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO).
