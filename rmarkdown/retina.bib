abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is the main reason for legal blindness and vision loss in the elderly in developed countries. Although the cause of AMD pathogenesis is not known, oxidative stress-related damage to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is considered an early event inAMDinduction. However, the precise cause of such damage and of the induction of oxidative stress, including related oxidative effects occurring in RPE and the onset and progression of AMD, are not well understood. Many results point to mitochondria as a source of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AMD. This ROS increase can be associated with aging and effects induced by other AMD risk factors and is correlated with damage to mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage can be an essential element of AMD pathogenesis. This is supported by many studies that show a greater susceptibility of mtDNA than nuclear DNA to DNA-damaging agents in AMD. Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA damage reaction (mtDDR) is important in AMD prevention and in slowing down its progression as is ROS-targeting AMD therapy. However, we know far less about mtDNA than its nuclear counterparts. Further research should measure DNA damage in order to compare it in mitochondria and the nucleus, as current methods have serious disadvantages},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, M{\"{u}}ller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult M{\"{u}}ller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease.},

abstract = {The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are complex tissues that provide crucial support to the retina. Disease affecting either of these supportive tissues can lead to irreversible blindness in the setting of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on macular and peripheral regions of RPE-choroid from 7 human donor eyes in 2 independent experiments. In the first experiment, total RPE/ choroid preparations were evaluated and expression profiles specific to RPE and major choroidal cell populations were identified. As choroidal endothelial cells represent a minority of the total RPE/ choroidal cell population but are strongly implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, a second single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment was performed using endothelial cells enriched by magnetic separation. In this second study, we identified gene expression signatures along the choroidal vascular tree, classifying the transcriptome of human choriocapillaris, arterial, and venous endothelial cells. We found that the choriocapillaris highly and specifically expresses the regulator of cell cycle gene (RGCC), a gene that responds to complement activation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition, RGCC was the most up-regulated choriocapillaris gene in a donor diagnosed with AMD. These results provide a characterization of the human RPE and choriocapillaris transcriptome, offering potential insight into the mechanisms of choriocapillaris response to complement injury and choroidal vascular disease in age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {The early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are characterized by the accumulation of basal laminar deposits (BLamDs). The mechanism for BLamDs accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its basal lamina remains elusive. Here we examined the role in AMD of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2), a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in lysosomal biogenesis and maturation of autophagosomes/ phagosomes. LAMP2 was preferentially expressed by RPE cells, and its expression declined with age. Deletion of the Lamp2 gene in mice resulted in age-dependent autofluorescence abnormalities of the fundus, thickening of Bruch's membrane, and the formation of BLamDs, resembling histopathological changes occurring in AMD. Moreover, LAMP2-deficient mice developed molecular signatures similar to those found in human AMD—namely, the accumulation of APOE, APOA1, clusterin, and vitronectin—adjacent to BLamDs. In contrast, collagen 4, laminin, and fibronectin, which are extracellular matrix proteins constituting RPE basal lamina and Bruch's membrane were reduced in Lamp2 knockout (KO) mice. Mechanistically, retarded phagocytic degradation of photoreceptor outer segments compromised lysosomal degradation and increased exocytosis in LAMP2-deficient RPE cells. The accumulation of BLamDs observed in LAMP2-deficient mice was eventually followed by loss of the RPE and photoreceptors. Finally, we observed loss of LAMP2 expression along with ultramicroscopic features of abnormal phagocytosis and exocytosis in eyes from AMD patients but not from control individuals. Taken together, these results indicate an important role for LAMP2 in RPE function in health and disease, suggesting that LAMP2 reduction may contribute to the formation of BLamDs in AMD.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Society for Leukocyte Biology. Inflammation is an adaptive response of the immune system to noxious insults to maintain homeostasis and restore functionality. The retina is considered an immune-privileged tissue as a result of its unique anatomic and physiologic properties. During aging, the retina suffers from a low-grade chronic oxidative insult, which sustains for decades and increases in level with advancing age. As a result, the retinal innate-immune system, particularly microglia and the complement system, undergoes low levels of activation (parainflammation). In many cases, this parainflammatory response can maintain homeostasis in the healthy aging eye. However, in patients with age-related macular degeneration, this parainflammatory response becomes dysregulated and contributes to macular damage. Factors contributing to the dysregulation of age-related retinal parainflammation include genetic predisposition, environmental risk factors, and old age. Dysregulated parainflammation (chronic inflammation) in age-related macular degeneration damages the blood retina barrier, resulting in the breach of retinal-immune privilege, leading to the development of retinal lesions. This review discusses the basic principles of retinal innate-immune responses to endogenous chronic insults in normal aging and in age-related macular degeneration and explores the difference between beneficial parainflammation and the detrimental chronic inflammation in the context of age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {The choroid is richly innervated by parasympathetic, sympathetic and trigeminal sensory nerve fibers that regulate choroidal blood flow in birds and mammals, and presumably other vertebrate classes as well. The parasympathetic innervation has been shown to vasodilate and increase choroidal blood flow, the sympathetic input has been shown to vasoconstrict and decrease choroidal blood flow, and the sensory input has been shown to both convey pain and thermal information centrally and act locally to vasodilate and increase choroidal blood flow. As the choroid lies behind the retina and cannot respond readily to retinal metabolic signals, its innervation is important for adjustments in flow required by either retinal activity, by fluctuations in the systemic blood pressure driving choroidal perfusion, and possibly by retinal temperature. The former two appear to be mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, via central circuits responsive to retinal activity and systemic blood pressure, but adjustments for ocular perfusion pressure also appear to be influenced by local autoregulatory myogenic mechanisms. Adaptive choroidal responses to temperature may be mediated by trigeminal sensory fibers. Impairments in the neural control of choroidal blood flow occur with aging, and various ocular or systemic diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), hypertension, and diabetes, and may contribute to retinal pathology and dysfunction in these conditions, or in the case of AMD be a precondition. The present manuscript reviews findings in birds and mammals that contribute to the above-summarized understanding of the roles of the autonomic and sensory innervation of the choroid in controlling choroidal blood flow, and in the importance of such regulation for maintaining retinal health.},

In this review we discuss the significance of complement activation in AMD, particularly with respect to the formation of the membrane attack complex in the aging choriocapillaris. We review the clinical, histological and biochemical data that indicate that vascular loss in the choroid occurs very early in the pathogenesis of AMD, and discuss the potential impact of vascular dropout on the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch's membrane and the photoreceptor cells. Finally, we present a hypothesis for the pathogenesis of early AMD and consider the implications of this model on the development of new therapies.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) involves the loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors and is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. Oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA has been associated with RPE dysfunction and AMD. In this study, we evaluated oxidative stress in AMD and the efficacy of antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), in protecting RPE from oxidative damage. To test this idea, primary cultures of RPE from human donors with AMD (n = 32) or without AMD (No AMD, n = 21) were examined for expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) genes, a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, the cells were pretreated with NAC for 2 hours and then treated with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) to induce cellular oxidation. Twenty-four hours after treatment, ROS production, cell survival, the content of glutathione (GSH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and cellular bioenergetics were measured. We found increased expression of p22phox, a NOX regulator, in AMD cells compared to No AMD cells (p = 0.02). In both AMD and No AMD cells, NAC pretreatment reduced t-BHP-induced ROS production and protected from H2O2-induced cell death and ATP depletion. In the absence of oxidation, NAC treatment improved mitochondrial function in both groups (p {\textless} 0.01). Conversely, the protective response exhibited by NAC was disease-dependent for some parameters. In the absence of oxidation, NAC significantly reduced ROS production (p {\textless} 0.001) and increased GSH content (p = 0.02) only in RPE from AMD donors. Additionally, NAC-mediated protection from H2O2-induced GSH depletion (p = 0.04) and mitochondrial dysfunction (p {\textless} 0.05) was more pronounced in AMD cells compared with No AMD cells. These results demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of NAC by mitigating oxidative damage in RPE. Additionally, the favorable outcomes observed for AMD RPE support NAC's relevance and the potential therapeutic value in treating AMD.},

The mechanism(s) responsible for massive and progressive retinal degeneration is not completely known. Senescence, a state of permanent inhibition of cell growth, may be induced by many factors important for AMD pathogenesis and results in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that releases growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases and other molecules inducing inflammation and other AMD-related effects. These effects can be induced in the affected cell and neighboring cells, leading to progression of AMD phenotype. Senescent cells also release reactive oxygen species that increase SASP propagation. Many other pathways of senescence-related AMD pathogenesis, including autophagy, the cGAS–STING signaling, degeneration of CC by membrane attack complex, can be considered. A2E, a fluorophore present in lipofuscin, amyloid-beta peptide and humanin, a mitochondria-derived peptide, may link AMD with senescence.

abstract = {Background: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial chronic disease of the eye. Several candidate pathways have been hypothesized to play a role in AMD pathogenesis. Our work and those of others suggests inflammasome activity as a mechanism associated with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell demise. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an anti-apoptosis factor, has recently been shown to regulate inflammasome activity in non-ocular cells. The purpose of this study is to characterize XIAP's regulatory role in RPE. Methods: Protein lysates of eye tissues from rats (vinpocetine- or aurin tricarboxylic acid complex-treated, ATAC, vs na{\"{i}}ve) and mice (wild type vs Caspase-4 -/- ) were utilized to analyze XIAP protein levels. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect NLRP3 levels in the RPE layer. In vitro inflammasome activation on RPE cells was achieved with L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (Leu-Leu-OMe) stimulation. Levels of XIAP mRNA and 18S RNA were quantified by RT-PCR. Cell culture supernatants were tested directly for secreted IL-1$\beta$ by ELISA or concentrated for the detection of secreted IL-18 by western blot. Protein lysates from RPE in cell culture were collected for the measurement of cleaved caspase-1 p20, XIAP, and GAPDH. Data are presented as Mean ± SD. p {\textless} 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Results: The XIAP protein level was significantly increased when the inflammasome was inhibited at the "activation" step by ATAC, but not the "priming" step, in vivo. Concomitantly, NLRP3 immunoreactivity was lower in the RPE layer of animals fed with ATAC. In mice where caspase-1 cleavage was impaired by the genetic deficiency in caspase-4, the XIAP protein level increased in eye tissues. In RPE cell culture, Leu-Leu-OMe stimulation led to caspase-1 cleavage, cytokine secretion, and XIAP reduction, which can be abolished by Z-YVAD-FMK. When XIAP siRNA was given as a pre-treatment to RPE in vitro, Leu-Leu-OMe induced IL-1$\beta$/IL-18 secretion was enhanced, whereas overexpressing XIAP reduced IL-1$\beta$ secretion under inflammasome activation, both compared to controls cells. Conclusions: Together, these data suggest XIAP-mediated inhibition of inflammasome activity in RPE may provide insights into the biological consequences of inflammasome activation in RPE and reveals the caspase-1/XIAP/IL-1$\beta$/IL-18 axis as a target for broader applications in AMD biology and treatment design.},

The transcriptome analysis reveals a highly significant and consistent impact on anti-sense transcription as well as moderate changes in the regulation of non-coding (sense) RNA. Hundreds of genes that do not express anti-sense transcripts in normal PR and PRCS demonstrate significant anti-sense expression in AMD in all patient samples.

abstract = {Heavy metals, metallic and toxic elements are reported to play an essential role in the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was aimed to measure the concentrations of these elements in choroid-RPE and retina of human donor eyes with and without age-related macular degeneration associated changes. Human cadaver donor eyeballs were obtained from the CU Shah eye bank, Sankara Nethralaya Eye Hospital, India, after removal of the cornea. 39 control and 51 AMD donor eyes were used in this study. Alabama grading was done on the histopathological sections to identify early and late age-related macular degeneration changes. Concentrations of lead, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, arsenic and selenium were determined in choroid-RPE and retina using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). Further, gene expression of oxidative stress-related genes, Nrf-2, HO-1, GCLC, GCLM, and detoxification related gene GSTpi was performed. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using Graph Pad{\textregistered} Prism 5 software. Donor eyes with early and late AMD had significantly higher levels of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and nickel in choroid-RPE and retina compared to the control eyes. Selenium was significantly increased in late AMD compared to control. No significant difference was observed in the levels of cobalt between eyes with and without AMD. Decreased transcript levels of oxidative stress-related genes were observed in the choroid-RPE and retinal tissues. Nrf-2 (p {\textless} 0.05), HO-1 and GCLC expressions were lowered in the retina of AMD, whereas GCLM and GSTpi expressions were decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) with an increase in HO-1 in choroid-RPE of AMD. This study provides evidence that alterations of the heavy metals and toxic elements along with oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD.},

abstract = {The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood–retina barrier and facilitates the transepithelial transport of glucose into the outer retina via GLUT1. Glucose is metabolized in photoreceptors via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but also by aerobic glycolysis to generate glycerol for the synthesis of phospholipids for the renewal of their outer segments. Aerobic glycolysis in the photoreceptors also leads to a high rate of production of lactate which is transported out of the subretinal space to the choroidal circulation by the RPE. Lactate taken up by the RPE is converted to pyruvate and metabolized via OXPHOS. Excess lactate in the RPE is transported across the basolateral membrane to the choroid. The uptake of glucose by cone photoreceptor cells is enhanced by rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) secreted by rods and by insulin signaling. Together, the three cells act as symbiotes: the RPE supplies the glucose from the choroidal circulation to the photoreceptors, the rods help the cones, and both produce lactate to feed the RPE. In age-related macular degeneration this delicate m{\'{e}}nage {\`{a}} trois is disturbed by the chronic infiltration of inflammatory macrophages. These immune cells also rely on aerobic glycolysis and compete for glucose and produce lactate. We here review the glucose metabolism in the homeostasis of the outer retina and in macrophages and hypothesize what happens when the metabolism of photoreceptors and the RPE is disturbed by chronic inflammation.},

abstract = {The human cell surface molecule CD34 is selectively expressed on uncommitted and committed hematopoietic progenitor cells and on vascular endothelial cells. It has been suggested that CD34 regulates early events in blood cell migration and differentiation, possibly as a cell adhesion molecule. To characterize the patterns of expression of CD34 in the mouse embryo and in the adult, as well as to dissect the function of different portions of the extracellular domain of this molecule, we have generated the first monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for mouse CD34. The epitope(s) recognized by these mAb are not carbohydrate moieties, and are comprised either within the immunoglobulin‐like domain or within a portion of the mucin domain, containing approximately half of the predicted O‐ and N‐linked carbohydrate attachment sites. The specificity of the antibodies was established by ELISA and Western blotting. Western analysis revealed that these mAb recognize a protein of approximately 110 kDa in PA6 stromal cell lysates, which can be specifically blocked by the recombinant CD34 protein. To establish the reactivity of these mAb on different cell lineages, a panel of cell lines was stained. This analysis showed strong reactivities with 3T3 fibroblasts, stromal cell lines from fetal liver and with the endothelial cell line D10. Bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors were also stained by these mAb. Immunostaining of frozen sections from embryonic and adult tissues revealed a strong reactivity against vascular endothelial cells at different stages of development, including sinusoidal cells in the fetal liver, yolk sac, and in the fetal bone marrow, endothelial cells from adult lung and kidney, and neural cells, including those of the neural tube of midgestation embryos and neuronal bodies in adult brain.

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people globally. It is estimated that there will be more Asians with AMD than the rest of the world combined by 2050. In Asian populations, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a common subtype of exudative AMD, while choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD (CNV-AMD) is the typical subtype in Western populations. The two subtypes share many common clinical features and risk factors, but also have different epidemiological and clinical characteristics, natural history and treatment outcomes that point to distinct pathophysiological processes. Recent research in the fields of genetics, proteomics and imaging has provided further clarification of differences between PCV and CNV-AMD. Importantly, these differences have manifested as disparity in response to intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment between PCV and CNV-AMD, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis of PCV and in distinguishing PCV from CNV-AMD, particularly in Asian patients. Current clinical trials of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and photodynamic therapy will provide clearer perspectives of evidence-based management of PCV and may lead to paradigm shifts in therapeutic strategies away from those currently employed in the treatment of CNV-AMD. Further research is needed to clarify the relative contribution of specific pathways in inflammation, complement activation, extracellular matrix dysregulation, lipid metabolism and angiogenesis to the pathogenesis of PCV. Findings from this research, together with improved diagnostic technology and new therapeutics, will facilitate more optimal management of Asian AMD.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To determine the pattern of drusen accumulation with age and to investigate the initial sites of deposition and their relationship to choroidal capillaries in human donor eyes from the eye bank of Moorfields Eye Hospital. METHODS. Wholemounted, hydrated preparations of the chorioc{\`{a}}pillaris and Bruch's membrane from donor eyes ranging from 42 to 95 years, with or without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), were examined by conventional and confocal microscopy. Drusen were visualized by their autofluorescence. RESULTS. In all age groups studied autofluorescent drusen were present at the equator but were not found centrally where the vascular architecture is different, being tubular rather than a honeycomb pattern. Autofluorescing drusen were strongly associated with the lateral walls of the choriocapillaris (an area commonly known as the intercapillary pillars of the choriocapillaris (P = 0.028; Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Nonfluorescing drusen were occasionally seen centrally, but were not easily identified, and because of their large size, their localization with respect to capillary walls was not possible. CONCLUSIONS. These results strongly support the notion that autofluorescent drusen are not randomly distributed and have a specific spatial relationship to choroidal vessel walls. That equatorial drusen fluoresce, whereas central drusen do not, suggests that they may have different chemical compositions at the two sites and possibly different significance in age-related macular disease.},

However, we have limited understanding of the timing of key events in the developing human retina, and in particular the factors critical for generating the unique architecture of the fovea and surrounding macula. Here we define three key epochs in the transcriptome dynamics of human retina from fetal day (D) 52 to 136. Coincident histological analyses confirmed the cellular basis of transcriptional changes and highlighted the dramatic acceleration of development in the fovea compared with peripheral retina. Human and mouse retinal transcriptomes show remarkable similarity in developmental stages, although morphogenesis was greatly expanded in humans. Integration of DNA accessibility data allowed us to reconstruct transcriptional networks controlling photoreceptor differentiation. Our studies provide insights into human retinal development and serve as a resource for molecular staging of human stem-cell-derived retinal organoids. Hoshino et al. describe transcriptome dynamics and spatiotemporal analyses of developing human retina, demonstrating distinct periods of neurogenesis in the fovea versus nasal retina. Comparison with mouse retinal transcriptomes and integration with open chromatin datasets reveal evolutionary conservation of developmental regulatory networks and unique characteristics of human retinal differentiation.},

abstract = {Purpose: To characterize the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using mass spectrometry (MS). Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Participants: We prospectively recruited participants with a diagnosis of AMD and a control group ({\textgreater}50 years of age) without any vitreoretinal disease. Methods: All participants underwent color fundus photography, used for AMD diagnosis and staging, according to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study classification scheme. Fasting blood samples were collected and plasma was analyzed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC), using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high-resolution MS. Metabolon's hardware and software were used to identify peaks and control quality. Principal component analysis and multivariate regression were performed to assess differences in the metabolomic profiles of AMD patients versus controls, while controlling for potential confounders. For biological interpretation, pathway enrichment analysis of significant metabolites was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were levels of plasma metabolites in participants with AMD compared with controls and among different AMD severity stages. Results: We included 90 participants with AMD (30 with early AMD, 30 with intermediate AMD, and 30 with late AMD) and 30 controls. Using UPLC and MS, 878 biochemicals were identified. Multivariate logistic regression identified 87 metabolites with levels that differed significantly between AMD patients and controls. Most of these metabolites (82.8{\%}; n = 72), including the most significant metabolites, belonged to the lipid pathways. Analysis of variance revealed that of the 87 metabolites, 48 (55.2{\%}) also were significantly different across the different stages of AMD. A significant enrichment of the glycerophospholipids pathway was identified (P = 4.7 × 10−9) among these metabolites. Conclusions: Participants with AMD have altered plasma metabolomic profiles compared with controls. Our data suggest that the most significant metabolites map to the glycerophospholipid pathway. These findings have the potential to improve our understanding of AMD pathogenesis, to support the development of plasma-based metabolomics biomarkers of AMD, and to identify novel targets for treatment of this blinding disease.},

@article{Fleckenstein2018,
abstract = {Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to progressive and irreversible loss of visual function. Geographic atrophy is defined by the presence of sharply demarcated atrophic lesions of the outer retina, resulting from loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and underlying choriocapillaris. These lesions typically appear first in the perifoveal macula, initially sparing the foveal center, and over time often expand and coalesce to include the fovea. Although the kinetics of GA progression are highly variable among individual patients, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific characteristics may be important in predicting disease progression and outcomes. This review synthesizes current understanding of GA progression in AMD and the factors known or postulated to be relevant to GA lesion enlargement, including both affected and fellow eye characteristics. In addition, the roles of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors in GA lesion enlargement are discussed. Overall, GA progression rates reported in the literature for total study populations range from 0.53 to 2.6 mm2/year (median, ∼1.78 mm2/year), assessed primarily by color fundus photography or fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. Several factors that could inform an individual's disease prognosis have been replicated in multiple cohorts: baseline lesion size, lesion location, multifocality, FAF patterns, and fellow eye status. Because best-corrected visual acuity does not correspond directly to GA lesion enlargement due to possible foveal sparing, alternative assessments are being explored to capture the relationship between anatomic progression and visual function decline, including microperimetry, low-luminance visual acuity, reading speed assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. Understanding GA progression and its individual variability is critical in the design of clinical studies, in the interpretation and application of clinical trial results, and for counseling patients on how disease progression may affect their individual prognosis.},

To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

Here we globally profile chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) from AMD and control patients. Global decreases in chromatin accessibility occur in the RPE with early AMD, and in the retina of advanced disease, suggesting that dysfunction in the RPE drives disease onset. Footprints of photoreceptor and RPE-specific transcription factors are enriched in differentially accessible regions (DARs). Genes associated with DARs show altered expression in AMD. Cigarette smoke treatment of RPE cells recapitulates chromatin accessibility changes seen in AMD, providing an epigenetic link between a known risk factor for AMD and AMD pathology. Finally, overexpression of HDAC11 is partially responsible for the observed reduction in chromatin accessibility, suggesting that HDAC11 may be a potential new therapeutic target for AMD.},

abstract = {Early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by degeneration of the choriocapillaris, the vascular supply of retinal photoreceptor cells. We assessed vascular loss during disease progression in the choriocapillaris and larger vessels in the deeper choroid. Human donor maculae from controls (n = 99), early AMD (n = 35), or clinically diagnosed with geographic atrophy (GA; n = 9, collected from outside the zone of retinal pigment epithelium degeneration) were evaluated using Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I labeling to discriminate between vessels with intact endothelial cells and ghost vessels. Morphometric analyses of choriocapillaris density (cross-sectional area of capillary lumens divided by length) and of vascular lumen/stroma ratio in the outer choroid were performed. Choriocapillaris loss was observed in early AMD (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.024) with greater loss in GA (Bonferroni-corrected P {\textless} 10−9), even in areas of intact retinal pigment epithelium. In contrast, changes in lumen/stroma ratio in the outer choroid were not found to differ between controls and AMD or GA eyes (P {\textgreater} 0.05), suggesting choriocapillaris changes are more prevalent in AMD than those in the outer choroid. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor-A levels were negatively correlated with choriocapillaris vascular density. These findings support the concept that choroidal vascular degeneration, predominantly in the microvasculature, contributes to dry AMD progression. Addressing capillary loss in AMD remains an important translational target.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To investigate variations in chorioretinal �vasculatures in fellow eyes of patients with unilateral neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). METHODS. We included fellow eyes of consecutive patients with unilateral nAMD from swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) angiography database. Vascular and nonvascular indices were determined based on SS-OCT and SS-OCT angiography images. Variation of the vascular or nonvascular index was compared between fellow eyes with and without early AMD. RESULTS. In 146 fellow eyes, 88 (60.3{\%}) had early AMD and 58 (39.7{\%}) had a normal fundus. Vascular density (VD) values of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus and choriocapillaris were smaller in eyes with early AMD than in those without (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.006, respectively). Flow void area in choriocapillaris was greater in eyes with early AMD than those without (P = 0.015). In 88 fellow eyes with early AMD, vascular indices of the retina were correlated with those of choroid while nonvascular indices were not. Fellow eyes of patients with classic exudative AMD had greater foveal avascular zone area and smaller VD values of the deep retinal capillary plexus than those with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (P {\textless} 0.001, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. In addition to vascular insufficiency in the choroid or choriocapillaris, retinal vascular alteration was apparent in eyes with early AMD. It may suggest that retinal vessels were involved in the pathogenesis of AMD even while changes in nonvascular components of the retina were not yet apparent.},

Visual (retinoid) cycle anomalies induce aberrant build-up of all-trans retinal (atRAL) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is a cause of RPE atrophy in Stargardt disease type 1 and age-related macular degeneration. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation is implicated in the etiology of age-related macular degeneration. Here, we elucidated the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and atRALinduced death of RPE cells. METHODS. Cellular toxicities were assessed by MTS or MTT assays. Expression levels of mRNAs and proteins were determined by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fluorescence microscopy was used to examine intracellular signals. Ultrastructural features of organelles were examined by transmission electron microscope. RESULTS. Abnormal accumulation of atRAL was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of human ARPE-19 cells exhibiting features of apoptosis and Caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis. These cells also exhibited elevated expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1/poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)/Caspase-3/GSDME, interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), and IL-18, as well as NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes (IL1B and IL18). After exposure of human ARPE-19 cells to excess atRAL, reactive oxygen species (ROS) (including mitochondrial ROS) and cathepsins released from lysosomes transmitted signals leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Suppressing the production of ROS, NLRP3 inflammasome, Caspase-1, cathepsin B, or cathepsin D protected ARPE-19 cells against atRAL-associated cytotoxicity. Damage to mitochondria, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum in atRAL-exposed ARPE-19 cells was partially alleviated by treatment with MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS. Aberrant build-up of atRAL promotes the death of RPE cells via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.},

abstract = {Structural and gene expression changes in the microvasculature of the human choroid occur during normal aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we sought to determine the impact of aging and AMD on expression of the endothelial cell glycoprotein CD34. Sections from 58 human donor eyes were categorized as either young (under age 40), age-matched controls ({\textgreater} age 60 without AMD), or AMD affected ({\textgreater}age 60 with early AMD, geographic atrophy, or choroidal neovascularization). Dual labeling of sections with Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I lectin (UEA-I) and CD34 antibodies was performed, and the percentage of capillaries labeled with UEA-I but negative for anti-CD34 was determined. In addition, published databases of mouse and human retinal pigment epithelium-choroid were evaluated and CD34 expression compared between young and old eyes. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that while CD34 and UEA-I were colocalized in young eyes, there was variable loss of CD34 immunoreactivity in older donor eyes. While differences between normal aging and AMD were not significant, the percentage of CD34 negative capillaries in old eyes, compared to young eyes, was highly significant (p = 3.8×10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Endothelial cells in neovascular membranes were invariably CD34 positive. Published databases show either a significant decrease in Cd34 (mouse) or a trend toward decreased CD34 (human) in aging. These findings suggest that UEA-I and endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity are more consistent markers of aging endothelial cells in the choroid, and suggest a possible mechanism for the increased inflammatory milieu in the aging choroid. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sohn et al.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a devastating disease-causing vision loss in millions of people around the world. In advanced stages of disease, death of photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) are common. Loss of endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris is one of the earliest detectable events in AMD, and, because the outer retina relies on the choriocapillaris for metabolic support, this loss may be the trigger for progression to more advanced stages. Here we highlight evidence for loss of CECs, including changes to vascular density within the choriocapillaris, altered abundance of CEC markers, and changes to overall thickness of the choroid. Furthermore, we review the key components and functions of the choroid, as well as Bruch's membrane, both of which are vital for healthy vision. We discuss changes to the structure and molecular composition of these tissues, many of which develop with age and may contribute to AMD pathogenesis. For example, a crucial event that occurs in the aging choriocapillaris is accumulation of the membrane attack complex, which may result in complement-mediated CEC lysis, and may be a primary cause for AMD-Associated choriocapillaris degeneration. The actions of elevated monomeric C-reactive protein in the choriocapillaris in at-risk individuals may also contribute to the inflammatory environment in the choroid and promote disease progression. Finally, we discuss the progress that has been made in the development of AMD therapies, with a focus on cell replacement.},

Using NucSeq, we find enriched expression of AMD candidate genes in RPE cells. We identify 15 putative causal genes for AMD on the basis of co-localization of genetic association signals for AMD risk and eye eQTL, including the genes TSPAN10 and TRPM1.

abstract = {Lineage studies conducted in the retina more than 25 years ago demonstrated the multipotency of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). The number and types of cells produced by individual RPCs, even from a single time point in development, were found to be highly variable. This raised the question of whether this variability was due to intrinsic differences among RPCs or to extrinsic and/or stochastic effects on equivalent RPCs or their progeny. Newer lineage studies that have made use of molecular markers of RPCs, retrovirus-mediated lineage analyses of specific RPCs and live imaging have begun to provide answers to this question. RPCs that produce two postmitotic daughter cells-that is, terminally dividing RPCs-have been the most well characterized RPCs to date, and have been shown to produce specific types of daughter cells. In addition, recent studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms that drive the temporal order in which retinal cells are born. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a mounting cause of loss of sight in the elderly in the developed countries, a trend enhanced by the continual ageing of the population. AMD is a multifactorial and only partly understood, malady. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for most AMD patients. It is known that oxidative stress (OS) damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and contributes to the progression of AMD. We review here the potential importance of two OS-related cellular systems in relation to AMD. First, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2)-mediated OS response signalling pathway is important in the prevention of oxidative damage and a failure of this system could be critical in the development of AMD. Second, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a change in the cellular phenotype, which ultimately leads to the fibrosis encountered in RPE, a characteristic of AMD. Many of the pathways triggering EMT are promoted by OS. The possible interconnections between these two signalling routes are discussed here. From a broader perspective, the control of NFE2L2 and EMT as ways of preventing OS-derived cellular damage could be potentially valuable in the therapy of AMD.},

Without the RPE, a majority of overlying photoreceptors ultimately degenerate, leading to severe, progressive vision loss. Clinical and histological studies suggest that RPE replacement strategies may delay disease progression or restore vision. A prospective, interventional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared, phase 1/2a study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a composite subretinal implant in subjects with advanced NNAMD. The composite implant, termed the California Project to Cure Blindness-Retinal Pigment Epithelium 1 (CPCB-RPE1), consists of a polarized monolayer of human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) on an ultrathin, synthetic parylene substrate designed to mimic Bruch's membrane. We report an interim analysis of the phase 1 cohort consisting of five subjects. Four of five subjects enrolled in the study successfully received the composite implant. In all implanted subjects, optical coherence tomography imaging showed changes consistent with hESC-RPE and host photoreceptor integration. None of the implanted eyes showed progression of vision loss, one eye improved by 17 letters and two eyes demonstrated improved fixation. The concurrent structural and functional findings suggest that CPCB-RPE1 may improve visual function, at least in the short term, in some patients with severe vision loss from advanced NNAMD.},

abstract = {The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2) in adult tissues is restricted to vascular endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. We have previously shown that the endothelial-specific in vivo activity of the human ICAM-2 promoter is contained within a small (0.33-kilobase (kbp)) 5'- flanking region of the gene. Here we describe the in vitro characterization of this region. The ICAM-2 promoter is TATA-less, and transcription in endothelial cells initiates at four sites. Reporter gene expression directed by the promoter was 125-fold greater than vector alone in bovine aortic endothelial cells but less than 2-fold vector alone in non-endothelial (COS) cells, confirming that specificity in vivo was paralleled in vitro. The addition of 2.7 kbp of 5'-flanking region to the 0.33-kbp fragment had no effect on promoter activity or specificity. The mutation of an Sp1 motif centered at base pair -194 or an eight-base pair palindrome at -268 each reduced promoter activity by 70{\%}. Mutation of GATA motifs at -145 and -53 reduced promoter activity by 78 and 61{\%}, respectively. Specific binding of bovine aortic endothelial cells nuclear proteins to the Sp1 and GATA sites was demonstrated by gel shift analysis. Promoter activity in COS cells was transactivated 3-4-fold by overexpression of GATA-2. The results presented here suggest that transcription from the ICAM-2 promoter in endothelial cells is regulated by the interplay of several positive-acting factors and provide the basis for further analysis of endothelial-specific gene expression.},

abstract = {Drusen are extracellular deposits that accumulate below the retinal pigment epithelium on Bruch's membrane and are risk factors for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The progression of AMD might be slowed or halted if the formation of drusen could be modulated. To work toward a molecular understanding of drusen formation, we have developed a method for isolating microgram quantities of drusen and Bruch's membrane for proteome analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem MS analyses of drusen preparations from 18 normal donors and five AMD donors identified 129 proteins. Immunocytochemical studies have thus far localized ≈16{\%} of these proteins in drusen. Tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 3, clusterin, vitronectin, and serum albumin were the most common proteins observed in normal donor drusen whereas crystallin was detected more frequently in AMD donor drusen. Up to 65{\%} of the proteins identified were found in drusen from both AMD and normal donors. However, oxidative protein modifications were also observed, including apparent crosslinked species of tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 and vitronectin, and carboxyethyl pyrrole protein adducts. Carboxyethyl pyrrole adducts are uniquely generated from the oxidation of docosahexaenoate-containing lipids. By Western analysis they were found to be more abundant in AMD than in normal Bruch's membrane and were found associated with drusen proteins. Carboxymethyl lysine, another oxidative modification, was also detected in drusen. These data strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative injury contributes to the pathogenesis of AMD and suggest that oxidative protein modifications may have a critical role in drusen formation.},

Methods: Participants in this study were 36 patients with non-neovascular AMD and drusen. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Results: In all studied cases, the presence of drusen was associated with choriocapillaris' reduced blood flow signal of different extent and severity. Three types of choriocapillaris' non-perfusion were observed, along with an association between the size of drusen and the morphology of choriocapillaris' density defect. Moreover, the extent of choriocapillaris' density change has been related to ellipsoid zone disruption and therefore to visual impairment. Conclusions: Our study showed that in patients with drusen due to non-neovascular AMD, there is choriocapillaris' impairment of different morphology in OCTA, which is mainly related to the size and location of the drusen.},

abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease underlined by the degradation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, photoreceptors, and choriocapillares, but the exact mechanism of cell death in AMD is not completely clear. This mechanism is important for prevention of and therapeutic intervention in AMD, which is a hardly curable disease. Present reports suggest that both apoptosis and pyroptosis (cell death dependent on caspase-1) as well as necroptosis (regulated necrosis dependent on the proteins RIPK3 and MLKL, caspase-independent) can be involved in the AMD-related death of RPE cells. Autophagy, a cellular clearing system, plays an important role in AMD pathogenesis, and this role is closely associated with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central event for advanced AMD. Autophagy can play a role in apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, but its contribution to AMD-specific cell death is not completely clear. Autophagy can be involved in the regulation of proteins important for cellular antioxidative defense, including Nrf2, which can interact with p62/SQSTM, a protein essential for autophagy. As oxidative stress is implicated in AMD pathogenesis, autophagy can contribute to this disease by deregulation of cellular defense against the stress. However, these and other interactions do not explain the mechanisms of RPE cell death in AMD. In this review, we present basic mechanisms of autophagy and its involvement in AMD pathogenesis and try to show a regulatory role of autophagy in RPE cell death. This can result in considering the genes and proteins of autophagy as molecular targets in AMD prevention and therapy.},

abstract = {Antihemophilic factor (AHF, Factor VIII) antigen was demonstrated in cultured human endothelial cells by immunofluorescence studies using monospecific rabbit antibody to human AHF. Control studies with cultured human smooth muscle cells and human fibroblasts were negative. By radioimmunoassay it was demonstrated that cultured human endothelial cells contain AHF antigen which is released into the culture medium. Cultured smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts did not have this property. Cultured endothelial cells incorporated radioactive amino acids into high molecular weight, AHF antigen rich protein fractions prepared from the culture media. 7{\%} of the radioactive amino acid counts incorporated into this material were precipitated by globulin prepared from rabbit antiAHF whereas normal rabbit globulin precipitated only 1.5{\%} of the counts. Although cultured endothelial cells actively synthesize AHF antigen, AHF procoagulant activity was not detected in the culture medium. Studies seeking a basis for the lack of procoagulant activity have not clarified this deficiency, but they have established that exogenous AHF procoagulant activity is not inactivated by the tissue culture system.},

In this study, we systematically profiled chromatin accessibility and transcriptional dynamics over long-term human retinal and RO development. Our results showed that ROs recapitulated the human retinogenesis to a great extent, but divergent chromatin features were also discovered. We further reconstructed the transcriptional regulatory network governing human and RO retinogenesis in vivo. Notably, NFIB and THRA were identified as regulators in human retinal development. The chromatin modifications between developing human and mouse retina were also cross-analyzed. Notably, we revealed an enriched bivalent modification of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in human but not in murine retinogenesis, suggesting a more dedicated epigenetic regulation on human genome.},

abstract = {Inflammation is a cellular response to factors that challenge the homeostasis of cells and tissues. Cell-associated and soluble pattern-recognition receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors, inflammasome receptors, and complement components initiate complex cellular cascades by recognizing or sensing different pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns, respectively. Cytokines and chemokines represent alarm messages for leukocytes and once activated, these cells travel long distances to targeted inflamed tissues. Although it is a crucial survival mechanism, prolonged inflammation is detrimental and participates in numerous chronic age-related diseases. This article will review the onset of inflammation and link its functions to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of severe vision loss in aged individuals in the developed countries. In this progressive disease, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) results in the death of photoreceptors, leading to a loss of central vision. The RPE is prone to oxidative stress, a factor that together with deteriorating functionality, e.g. decreased intracellular recycling and degradation due to attenuated heterophagy/autophagy, induces inflammation. In the early phases, accumulation of intracellular lipofuscin in the RPE and extracellular drusen between RPE cells and Bruch's membrane can be clinically detected. Subsequently, in dry (atrophic) AMD there is geographic atrophy with discrete areas of RPE loss whereas in the wet (exudative) form there is neovascularization penetrating from the choroid to retinal layers. Elevations in levels of local and systemic biomarkers indicate that chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of both disease forms.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, remains only partially understood. This has led to the current lack of accessible and reliable biofluid biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and absence of treatments for dry AMD. This study aimed to assess the plasma metabolomic profiles of AMD and its severity stages with the ultimate goal of contributing to addressing these needs. We recruited two cohorts: Boston, United States (n = 196) and Coimbra, Portugal (n = 295). Fasting blood samples were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. For each cohort, we compared plasma metabolites of AMD patients versus controls (logistic regression), and across disease stages (permutation-based cumulative logistic regression considering both eyes). Meta-analyses were then used to combine results from the two cohorts. Our results revealed that 28 metabolites differed significantly between AMD patients versus controls (false discovery rate (FDR) q-value: 4.1 × 10−2–1.8 × 10−5), and 67 across disease stages (FDR q-value: 4.5 × 10−2–1.7 × 10−4). Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of glycerophospholipid, purine, taurine and hypotaurine, and nitrogen metabolism (p-value ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, our findings support that AMD patients present distinct plasma metabolomic profiles, which vary with disease severity. This work contributes to the understanding of AMD pathophysiology, and can be the basis of future biomarkers and precision medicine for this blinding condition.},

abstract = {Precise temporal control of gene expression in neuronal progenitors is necessary for correct regulation of neurogenesis and cell fate specification. However, the cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each major retinal cell type. We identify the NFI transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as selectively expressed in late retinal progenitor cells and show that they control bipolar interneuron and M{\"{u}}ller glia cell fate specification and promote proliferative quiescence. We use single-cell RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively profile gene expression during mouse retinal development. We find major differences between early and late-stage, as well as primary and neurogenic, progenitors. We also find that NFI factors control cell-cycle exit and generation of late-born cell types.},

abstract = {The human retina is a complex tissue responsible for detecting photons of light and converting information from these photons into the neurochemical signals interpreted as vision. Such visual signaling not only requires sophisticated interactions between multiple classes of neurons, but also spatially-dependent molecular specialization of individual cell types. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on neural retina isolated from both the fovea and peripheral retina in three human donors. We recovered a total of 8,217 cells, with 3,578 cells originating from the fovea and 4,639 cells originating from the periphery. Expression profiles for all major retinal cell types were compiled, and differential expression analysis was performed between cells of foveal versus peripheral origin. Globally, mRNA for the serum iron binding protein transferrin (TF), which has been associated with age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis, was enriched in peripheral samples. Cone photoreceptor cells were of particular interest and formed two predominant clusters based on gene expression. One cone cluster had 96{\%} of cells originating from foveal samples, while the second cone cluster consisted exclusively of peripherally isolated cells. A total of 148 genes were differentially expressed between cones from the fovea versus periphery. Interestingly, peripheral cones were enriched for the gene encoding Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 2 (BCO2). A relative deficiency of this enzyme may account for the accumulation of carotenoids responsible for yellow pigment deposition within the macula. Overall, this data set provides rich expression profiles of the major human retinal cell types and highlights transcriptomic features that distinguish foveal and peripheral cells.},

abstract = {Purpose: To differentiate the plasma metabolomic profile of patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD) from that of controls, by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Methods: Two cohorts (total of 396 subjects) representative of central Portugal and Boston, USA phenotypes were studied. For each cohort, subjects were grouped according to AMD stage (early, intermediate and late). Multivariate analysis of plasma NMR spectra was performed, followed by signal integration and univariate analysis. Results: Small changes were detected in the levels of some amino acids, organic acids, dimethyl sulfone and specific lipid moieties, thus providing some biochemical information on the disease. The possible confounding effects of gender, smoking history and age were assessed in each cohort and found to be minimal when compared to that of the disease. A similar observation was noted in relation to age-related comorbidities. Furthermore, partially distinct putative AMD metabolite fingerprints were noted for the two cohorts studied, reflecting the importance of nutritional and other lifestyle habits in determining AMD metabolic response and potential biomarker fingerprints. Notably, some of the metabolite changes detected were noted as potentially differentiating controls from patients diagnosed with early AMD. Conclusion: For the first time, this study showed metabolite changes in the plasma of patients with AMD as compared to controls, using NMR. Geographical origins were seen to affect AMD patients' metabolic profile and some metabolites were found to be valuable in potentially differentiating controls from early stage AMD patients. Metabolomics has the potential of identifying biomarkers for AMD, and further work in this area is warranted.},

Here we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified retina-specific epigenetic memory.},
